Subject: Change in invoice
Dear Sir,
I am writing on behalf of ABC Company which, as I am sure you know, assembles smartphones for your company. I have to inform you that the price of our service is going to rise by 4%. We were forced to increase our workers' salary in order to avoid a strike, which sadly affects the cost of our services. I hope this change will not sour the relationship between our companies. You have my assurance that there is room for negotation regarding the rise in costs. Please accept our sincere apologies for any issue this may cause and do not hesitate to contact me if you were to have any questions regarding this subject.
Yours Sincerely,
XYZ
