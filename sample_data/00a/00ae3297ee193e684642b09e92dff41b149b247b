In the dry cement basement two men were ready. Every speck of dust had been purged. Beakers had been placed, boilers had been assembled. Trading companies had been bribed for materials, all demands had been met. And now the dark, pungent liquid was kept in barrels, lined up against the wall. Today this sanctum would be required for the last time. By eight AM the men had arrived from their homes, and a separate life began. By nine, preparations had been made, and the duo was in uniform: polyester yellow coats, plastic vapor masks, sometimes rubber gloves. The chambers had been fired up, reverberating and perspiration, their switches checked and illuminated. The cautious proprietor surveyed the room by camera. Leaning against the railing the overseer watched, examining the routine. The chemists were ready to cook.
