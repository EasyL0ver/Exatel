The mail warns user about subscription renewal . The link used for this campaing is: http://www.allatorretta.com/wp-admin/js/ (62.149.140.208)
The page is a puzzle of jpeg images showing a renewal request form that should be filled with all user data including the credit card details. The scirpt ./njl.php steals the credi card data and runs another .php file "sms.php" that shows another page where the user should insert a pin code "sent" via sms.
