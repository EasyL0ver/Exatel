[justify][color=red]✿[/color][color=green]◦[/color][i]Anarosa is a female, anthropomorphic Roserade (Pokemon) that has a shortstack body. Anarosa is a domesticated anthro Pokemon who works with both people and Pokemon alike, even though she has no actual owner. The Roserade has an occupation of being a gardener of sorts, and uses her status as a plant to communicate with the nature around her. It may be silly to have a job as a plant whisperer, but Anarosa is able to do this job rather well in order to make sure everything in the garden grows to its fullest potential. Being in a garden though is like being in her natural habitat because she herself is a plant, even if she is  more personalized than a standard flower. She even resides in the garden, living in a small house just outside the garden she watches over, just so she can be ready to care for it whenever needed. Despite having a lot of dedication to the garden, she isn't someone who is going to be stuck in the sun by all the plants all day! This roserade is a bit more social and enjoys it when people go through her garden and she even invites herself to the various parties that are thrown within it. She isn't just going to events in her garden though, as she does like adventuring out into town and being a bit of a social flower. [color=yellow]~[/color]

[color=yellow]~[/color]Anarosa isn't much of a fighter, and when she has to get involved in some kind of conflict she would rather rely on techniques that either ward off those who are opposing her or use skills that she naturally has as a Roserade. A lot of her techniques are just naturally picked up and are shared among all of those who are Roserade or Roselia. A key power that Anarosa has is that 'sweet scent' is kind of a signature move (even though its not on her move pool), as she always lures in people with her wonderful odors. This can allow for more people to see her garden to which she is happen to show off, but there are times where the near hypnotic odor can get her in a bit of trouble.  This Roserade isn't best Pokemon if you were looking for a hyper competitive Pokemon that wants to battle as this plant girl doesn't really care about that stuff that much. One thing that Ana does forget time to time that she is a poison type, so at times her bodily fluids from her sweat to her cum could be a bit toxic and have some kind of negative effect to it. As she never cared to make her body super toxic though the poisons only act as a light toxin though and at worse would just stun people for a moment.

[justify][color=red]✿[/color][color=green]◦[/color][i]This little flower has a rather laid back personality, she is an easy going person who is easy to approach and doesn't hold out aggression towards anyone else. She is a bit of a tomboy despite being engulfed in an interest of flowers and gardening. Anna doesn't like to do things outside of what she is interested to, and can be a bit apathetic towards other things that don't appeal to her, but she is a very "whatever floats your boat" kind of gal with their inability to judge others for things that are harmless. She is a hard worker who works with passion, and adores when other people are willing to put out the same amount of work as her. She doesn't mind breaking a sweat or two so long as what she is doing makes her happy and or is productive overall. Anna is the kind of person who you could chill with for hours and there would be no disagreements, she isn't an aggressive person at all, and would rather plant flowers than deal with other problems in her life. When she is delighted by someones company she will become more flirtatious and start to tease them a bit. If Anna is teasing you and mocking you, its usually out of good fun and it means she likes you as a friend (or maybe more some) [color=yellow]~[/color]

[color=yellow]~[/color]As far as Anna's sexual nature goes, she is somewhat of a switch who doesn't appear to be much of a dominant at all. She herself isn't much of a fighter, but she has the ability to use more dominant leaning moves if she wants too. If she were a dominant she'd be more of a "hey kid, check out these neat smut tricks" kind of dominant, rather than one that has to get aggressive to demonstrate how much of a bad bitch mistress they are. She has a very easy going and chilled out view of sex and smut which is reflected by her position for it. She herself isn't going to whimper and bend over easily either, as its just not something that she herself would find that enjoyable. Anna is fine just doing whatever comes and goes, and if something happens and she enjoys it, she will let it happen either way. Mutual themed stuff and switch themes work best with Anna, but as always noncon scenes can be imposed as well which break the idea of a characters sexual approach to things by forcing them into things. Hell, even though she isn't dominant, she can be "switch-broken" to where she becomes super submissive due to someone elses hands. [/i][color=green]◦[/color][color=blue]✿[/color][/justify]

[quote]This is a copy/pasted thing from [url=https://www.f-list.net/thread.php?thread=123732]this thread[/url] about Pokemon typings and their cum. Here is the information about grass and poison types!

Grass - Sap-like, in both consistency and taste, being slightly sweet. For males, it has a slight honey-like flavor to it in most cases. Try not to get it in your hair/fur, it's even harder to get out than regular cum! Females are a little more tempting; With a sweet enticing aroma, Grass-types can often attract unwanted attention. It doesn't help that these plant types thrive on seeds and flourish easily. With a sweet nectar flavor, Grass-type females are the easiest to breed with the shortest gestation.

 Poison - May cause negative side effects in both male and female recipients. Hallucinogenic properties, physical illness or nausea, etc. Essentially one of the reasons Pokephilia is looked down upon. Generally not dangerous to males on contact, prolonged exposure can result in muscle cramps and rash while ingesting Poison-type semen or female fluids can result in the above-mentioned symptoms. Extremely difficult to breed, the feminine fluids have been studied for their spermicidal properties. Only Steel-types or other Poison-types are immune to its toxic effects. Not recommended for humans.

For Roserade, this means her cum would probably be sweet, sticky, but can have some toxins within it!

[justify][color=red]✿[/color][color=green]◦[/color][i]The body type presented in [url=https://static.f-list.net/images/charimage/9392951.jpg]this[/url] link really shows what Roserade is going to look like, she is a shortstack who seems a little bit pudgy on the sides, but her bottom portions are fat and thicc. She has a sizable bust as well, but its nothing compared to her bottom. Anna has green skin, has white hair, and bright red eyes. She wears a mask and a green dress made out of leaves and flowers. Roserade never remove their mask under any circumstance, so she wears that thing all the time. She could grow out her white hair more if she wanted too, but she would have to put a lot of extra attention to 'growing' herself. As she is a plant, she can make herself bigger with ease as all she needs to do is sit out in the sun and drink lots of water. Her size is a bit bulkier than most, but she is someone who spends her free time and work time out in a garden so what do you expect. [/i][color=green]◦[/color][color=blue]✿[/color][/justify]

[quote]There are a number of moves that Roserade can use, and Anarosa has a lot of moves that work off of her utility rather than her offensive stats. She is good for creating scents, attracting things to her, and even setting up defensive traps if she even wanted to do. These are a list of moves, and what sexual themes they could have when it comes to a scene. All of these are canonical moves that Roserade can learn, however the combat descriptions are better suited for serebii![/quote]
