Yu: Hold still Kao-chan! I'll take a picture of you.
Yu: Norie-chan!
Yu: Maon-chan!
Yu: Thanks for your cooperation!
Ka: Why suddenly you take our picture?
Yu: I just thought to send them to Chihiro-chan at Shioiri (Kagawa prefecture).
No: Oh, the one you've been friend with.
Ma: Will a tamayura shown on our photos?
Ka: I guess not, since you take them in this "ordinary" place.
No: Then why don't we do it like this!
No: Kaoru, I love you so!
Ka: Stop it!
Everyone: Potte, are you okay?
Yu: yes, I'm fine.
Yu: Wow, it's momoneko-sama!
Ka: Hey, did you take a picture of it just now?
No: You might accidently take a tamayura on the picture.
YU (narator): This spring, I moved from my hometown and entered  a highschool at this reminiscence town. A place where my late father so fond of. A place where he taught me how to take pictures. The reason why I start to take pictures again because I don't want all my happy memories to be dyed in sadness. When you take apicture while you feel light and happy, little children of light are reflected in it. They're called tamayura. My father also taught me this. Tamayura will make you happier once you see it. That's why I'll take picture with this camera.

Natsu no nokori ame ni
Eki made hashittetta kimi no ushiro sugata
Hansode no seifuku awatete oikaketa
matsuge ni mizutama hajikete
Sekaijuu no yasashii mono utsukushii iro wo shitteta
Demo sekai ha shiranakatta ano koro
Okaerinasai omoide ni
Nakitai toki aitai toki koko ni iru yo
Okaerinasai watashitachi ga
Yumemita mono aishita mono ima mo kimi wo mamotteru yo
