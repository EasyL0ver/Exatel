<EMJ> so 6 saal pehle hum luck lucknow se bombay aaye
<EMJ> june ka mahina tha aur poore bombay mein baadh jaisi baarish ho rahi thi
<EMJ> it was just me and my mom
<EMJ> I didn't like bombay one bit
<EMJ> and I was totally unemployed
<EMJ> my mom has a government jon
<EMJ> *job
<EMJ> she works in a government scientific facility
<EMJ> nothing fancy
<Reddictor> nva: Hindi is fine.
<EMJ> oho
<EMJ> wait na... autocorrect ruins hindi
<EMJ> we moved into this govt apartment complex
<EMJ> people from delhi must have seen how govt quarters look?
<EMJ> boxy structures
<EMJ> anyway
<EMJ> so the complex houses both officers and class 4 staff (peons etc)
<EMJ> right behind our building is my mom's peon's house,
<EMJ> from my bedroom i can look inside
<EMJ> its always dark and there some sort of halla-gulla always coming
<EMJ> neighbours say its the peons father
<EMJ> he is a senile old man
<EMJ> totally mental
<poop_monster> halla galla ?
<EMJ> and violent
<EMJ> *gulla
<poop_monster> What mins
<EMJ> shor
<poop_monster> (sorry)
<poop_monster> ahh okay
<poop_monster> sorry
<EMJ> the peon is a local marathi guy
<EMJ> he lives in a 1 bedroom apartment with his wife, 3 sons and his crazy father
<EMJ> the father is nasty
<EMJ> flings shit on bahu
<EMJ> throws around dishes
<EMJ> gives gandi gandi gaaliyan
<EMJ> anyway
<EMJ> one day my mom tells me that the father guy has died
<EMJ> and we must pay the house a visit
<EMJ> because you know... formality
<EMJ> i reach late
<EMJ> almost everyone has left the shok sabha
<EMJ> a few people are sitting and remembering things about the guy
<EMJ> they are alarmed about something
<EMJ> what is it?
<EMJ> my mom tells me the story in a hushed voice
<EMJ> apparently the marathi peon was not always poor and anpadh
<EMJ> he came from a very old brahmin family in some remote Maharashtrian village
<EMJ> the father was a scholar
<EMJ> one day while swimming in the river
<EMJ> he found a book
<EMJ> a book?
<EMJ> yes, a book,
<EMJ> it was wrapped  carefully
<EMJ> not destroyed by water
<EMJ> he opened the book but could not read it
<EMJ> it was written in a strange script
<EMJ> he took it home and showed his father
<EMJ> who was shocked
<EMJ> the book wasn't supposed to exist
<EMJ> it was folklore
<EMJ> a book written in an ancient text called neelvanti
<EMJ> the book was supposedly destroyed because it was evil
<EMJ> it was evil not because of some jadoo tona
<EMJ> it was evil because the vidhya/ the gyan/ the secret to some higher sense of being was written in it
<EMJ> everyone who read it went mad
<EMJ> tore of their clothes and ran away from home
<EMJ> (am i boring you guys?)
<poop_monster> NO GO AHEAD
<Reddictor> NO
<EMJ> good
