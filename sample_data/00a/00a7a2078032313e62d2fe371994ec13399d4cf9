00:59	Holben	(you type /mode #newchannel +m to go +m and /voice nick to give someone voice, letting them speak during +M)
00:59	Holben	It was a single, repeating note.
00:59		+++ Holben set the channel to mode +m
00:59		+++ Reject set the channel to mode -m
00:59	Reject	now
00:59	Reject	speak
00:59	Tanhony	lo
01:00	Holben	The note wasn't particularly loud.
01:00	Holben	But it was there, and it woke me up.
01:00	Holben	I blinked, and tried to make out what was causing it-
01:01	Holben	but it was still indistinct.
01:01	Holben	Perhaps too far off to hear.
01:01	Holben	I tried to stand up, but something held me down.
01:01	Holben	My face was flat against a carpet of hay, which was rough against my cheek and brow.
01:02	Holben	Things swam slowly into focus, but there was little to see.
01:02	Holben	I couldn't move my head, so I could only make out the far wall- concrete- and the single bulb on the ceiling.
01:03	Holben	The note.
01:03	Holben	It was a high c- I could make that out now.
01:03	Holben	I struggled a little, trying to test whatever held me.
01:03	Holben	My sleeves ripped within something, but my wrists were still caught.
01:04	Holben	I could feel cold metal against them.
01:04	Holben	And then a curious sensation on the soles of my feet.
01:04	Holben	A tickling.
01:04	Holben	But it was wet, and whatever was doing it was making a slapping sound.
01:05	Holben	I tried to get my head round again, but nothing.
01:05	Holben	The note again- it was a whistle.
01:05	Holben	Was there someone behind me?
01:05	Holben	Perhaps they were tickiling me.
01:06	Holben	I bent my hand as far as I could inside its confines, trying to feel whatever lock it bore.
01:06	Holben	Sure enough, the cuffs had a keyhole.
01:07	Holben	Squirming, I put my fingernail inside, and tried to turn it.
01:07	Holben	But the tickling grew more intense, and I laughed, losing my concentration.
01:07	Holben	"Stop it!" I giggled.
01:08	Holben	But the tickling did not stop, and I still had no idea what was causing it.
01:08	Holben	The whistle again.
01:08	Holben	Four notes now.
01:08	Holben	Dum-dum-dee-dee
01:08	Holben	Dum-dum-dee-dee
01:09	Holben	And I felt a kind of fear.
01:09	Holben	I could not move, I could not see, and I was being tickled.
01:10	Holben	I felt the metal grip around my ankles lessen and then disappear, and felt a slight comfort as I moved it once more.
01:11	Holben	But I regretted it instantly as my toes brushed against something slimy and rough, something behind me-
01:11	Holben	Dum-dum-dee-dee
01:11	Holben	The tickling was moving up from my feet.
01:12	Holben	It passed over my ankles and reached my lower leg-
01:12	Holben	but there it just felt empty.
01:12	Holben	I tried to move my foot again, but nothing responded.
01:12	Holben	I tried my other foot.
01:12	Holben	But it was as if they were no longer there.
01:12	Holben	Panic.
01:13	Holben	I felt a tickling on my fingertips, and it was wet and rough again.
01:13	Holben	I brushed against it, and it was slime.
01:13	Holben	And my fingers stopped responding.
01:14	Holben	Then my wrist.
01:14	Holben	Then my elbow.
01:14	Holben	My knees, my hips-
01:14	Holben	some kind of deathly numbness was filling me up.
01:14	Holben	But then I saw it.
01:15	Holben	Coming over the straw, towards my face, was a black pseudopod.
01:15	Holben	It crawled inexorably and almost smoothly over the rough hay, and I tried to recoil as it touched me.
01:16	Holben	But there was nowhere to go.
01:16	Holben	Its tip was on my chin, and I felt it spread over my jaw, holding it shut.
01:16	Holben	I saw it climbing on my nose.
01:16	Holben	My jaw stopped responding.
01:17	Holben	And then I watched as my nose was slowly broken apart before my eyes.
01:17		+++ Holben has taken op from Holben
01:17	Holben	End

01:28	Reject	i am alive
01:28	Reject	do not fear
01:28		Holben fears
01:29		Reject calms
01:29	Reject	yesterday morning
01:29	Reject	i woke up feeling quite sniffly
01:29	Reject	from there, by noon, i had a headache
01:29	Reject	by 3:00, i couldnt talk
01:29	Reject	cuz my throat was in so much pain
01:30	Reject	by 6:00 i was out of baseball practice
01:30	Reject	barely able to move
01:30	Reject	everything ached
01:30	Reject	everything was sore
01:30	Reject	i couldn't think straight, eat, drink
01:30	Reject	my only solace was that it would be over in a couple of days
01:31	Reject	but I never realized that, well, tomorrow is not promised today
01:31	Reject	soon, i began to despair
01:31	Reject	sure, having a cold isn't the worst thing in the /world/
01:33	Reject	and no, a cold itself isn't all that bad
01:34	Reject	but there are things that are that bad
01:34	Reject	by midnight, i had quelled my fears, calming myself by hanging out with a bunch of creepypasta writers on the internet
01:34	Reject	i woke up during the night many times, sweaty and screaming
01:34	Reject	but what did i dream?
01:35	Reject	maybe a dreamt about deserts, because my mouth felt like one
01:35	Reject	when i woke up in the morning, i realized that there are things worse than cold
01:36	Reject	i itched immensely. Instinctively, i looked at my arms
01:36	Reject	they were absolutely covered in hives. Bright red, bulbous hives
01:36	Reject	i let out a yelp of terror, hoping desperately for aid
01:37	Reject	my mother ran in hurriedly, asking why the hell i woke her up
01:37	Reject	i showed her my arms
01:37	Reject	she crossed hers
01:37	Reject	i pointed to the hives
01:37	Reject	she said that there was nothing special there
01:38	Reject	and left, just like that
01:38	Reject	if i wasnt already unable to think straight, this would have fucked my mind pretty bad
01:39	Reject	i tried my best to ignore them for the rest of the day. i really did.
01:39	Reject	scratching myself incessantly for no reason? I did the most I could under the circumstances.
01:40	Reject	it felt like too much
01:40	Reject	no SCPs have given me the pure horror of /not/ knowing what was going on with my own body
01:40	Reject	and having no one else even recognize it
01:41	Reject	until about 15 minutes ago
01:41	Reject	scratching my left elbow
01:41	Reject	and the hive popped
01:41	Reject	out came a large...
01:41	Reject	bug
01:42	Reject	just like this
01:42	Reject	
01:43	Reject	it began to pop the other hives effortlessly, releasing a swarm of... whateverthefuckthatisohmygodgetitoff onto me
01:43	Reject	but nobody noticed, nope
01:43	Reject	no chicken noodle soup this time
01:43	Reject	no medicine cures giant fucking bugs on your skin
01:43	Reject	they began to bite
01:43	Reject	individually, it would have been bearable
01:43	Reject	but it was 1000 fold
01:44	Reject	i can feel the skin being taken off
01:44	Reject	my right leg is nearly gone
01:44	Reject	i scream and scream, but no one sees it
01:44	Reject	it's a mricale that i can stilm tyop
