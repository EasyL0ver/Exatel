[08:21] ˢʰᵃᵉ (feyremalreaux): "Get your free STD's here!"
[08:21] TeeRexx (juniemo): It's randomized which one you get!
[08:21] ˢʰᵃᵉ (feyremalreaux): "Flip a coin in and prepare for the mysterious disease that will strike you? Will it be Chlamydia? Herpes?"
[08:21] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): Nah, no STD's anymore, I've been forbidden from Demoning.
[08:21] TeeRexx (juniemo): You have?
[08:21] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): Virtually.
[08:22] TeeRexx (juniemo): But he was so much fun
[08:22] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): Well now apparently everyone who was afflicted knows they were afflicted despite the card saying they didn't know.
[08:22] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): And Seeing as my character was virtually entirely manipulation and spreading his will through covert means that essentially scraps my demon.
[08:23] Dawn (dawnfalling): Sounds like an STD
[08:23] TeeRexx (juniemo): I decided to ex off Faymian after realizing that I enjoy playing big dumb hunky boys far too much. So, we've both lost something :<
[08:23] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): But what am I gonna do, I mean, I didn't get an app approved so my char's powers mean nothing.
[08:24] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): Essentially what this has told me is that playing evil characters with any grand plans in Lynnea is pointless.
[08:26] Liliana Fellblade (lilymunsters): Marcus
[08:27] ˢʰᵃᵉ (feyremalreaux): xD
[08:27] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): EJECT ME, DO IT
[08:27] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran) spreads his arms wide
[08:27] Liliana Fellblade (lilymunsters): You can, indeed, be evil and have a grand plan.
[08:27] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): Apparently not.
[08:27] Liliana Fellblade (lilymunsters): However, the right channels for a wide scale plot must be approved.
[08:27] Liliana Fellblade (lilymunsters): Let's not mix words here.
[08:27] TeeRexx (juniemo): I'm evil and have a grand plan.
[08:28] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): I already accepted that, but my abilities were basically axed.
[08:28] TeeRexx (juniemo): *ojou sama laugh*
[08:28] TeeRexx (juniemo): OH-HOHOHOHO
[08:28] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): And with it went my character.
[08:28] ˢʰᵃᵉ (feyremalreaux): Well, let me put it this way. What exactly would this plan be
[08:28] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): I was poisoning Lynnea's people.
[08:28] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): So that they would be tainted with Lust and Desire, thus creating a more idea world for say, my incubus.
[08:28] Liliana Fellblade (lilymunsters): If you want to talk about it further- we can in im. But really, you have to be upfront about the entire situation instead of making a blanket statement that all evil doers are denied. Lol.
[08:29] Hotep Zadark: How sweet
[08:29] Liliana Fellblade (lilymunsters): 'ello Hotep
[08:29]  Kїaηa ℬlackωolf   (reileena.ocello) wiffles bats hotep
[08:29] TeeRexx (juniemo): are there ever going to be any plans to give us the option to have more than two characters
[08:29] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): Lil, Talking about it is pointless, Eerika made it clear enough that it was axed
[08:29] Hotep Zadark: Hola'
[08:29] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): And in some way made it seem like that because it wasn't a Lynnea staff idea it wasn't a good one.
[08:29] Tarron Venroris (johnmcmanslaughter): Then... why are you tlaking about it?
[08:29] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): Because I can, To piss you all off.

[08:30] Tarron Venroris (johnmcmanslaughter): Its just making you look dumb
[08:30] ˢʰᵃᵉ (feyremalreaux): Honestly, I've not been around the RP-sim for long enough nor on the right time-zone to be properly involved
[08:30] OPAL (op4l): well in that grand scheme, seems to me, you would run up against each persons consent, not really just your grand scheme.  imo

[08:30] Marcus il Lowengrim (xarandele.tyran): I had consent Opal
