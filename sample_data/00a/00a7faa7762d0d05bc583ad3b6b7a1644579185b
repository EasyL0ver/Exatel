Basically,

The reason my account was banned was in my eyes a false warning which lead to the ban of my account.

My account Daniel was banned for "Same IP transfers".

Let me explain the reason why I was banned:-

My girlfriend was logged into her account via her laptop.
My account 'Daniel' was logged into my phone.

I wanted to send her 350 credits to revive somebody because my phone wasn't powerful enough to do visit the credit page.

Knowing that I could not of logged into my Daniel account on her laptop because it would of been same IP transfer.

I used my phone thinking I could send the credits, the problem was, once I walk into my girlfriends house my mobile phone automatically connected to her WI-FI, which then meant in theory, I was on the same IP as her.

In my eyes it was a mistake that I didn't realize I connected to her WI-FI, it was a little harsh to penalize my account for a silly mistake.

The next day I sent a helpdesk ticket asking if I could send my girlfriend some money from my account to her account on the same IP. And, the reply was "sure" from Adam.

I believe I could have a chance to get my account unbanned for the reasons mentioned above.

Thanks,
Daniel.
