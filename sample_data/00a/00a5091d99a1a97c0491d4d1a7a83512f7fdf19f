I dont know what else you want

fine. but for future you need to followup on stuff like this. if you want to say you're the captain of us you need to be responsible for this stuff
scarlet classic 5 is in april and one of the admins said there might be another tourney that rutgers runs in march
i'm going to lurk in the rutgers esports discord to keep track of anything that pops up
