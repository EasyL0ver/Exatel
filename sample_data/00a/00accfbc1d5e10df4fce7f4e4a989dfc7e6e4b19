The last, and aptly-titled, of Gene Autry&#39;s starring westerns finds Pony Express rider Gene Autry (<a href=">Gene Autry) deciding to start a stage line to carry the mail, since with the coming of the telegraph, the need for the Pony Express no longer exists. He is fired by his boss Tom McEwen (<a href=">John Downey) for being disloyal. Scheming townsmen Clyde Vesey (<a href=">Howard Wright), Jess Hogan (Arthur Space&#39;) and Dutch Murdoch (<a href=">Gregg Barton), in order to get a government mail contract for themselves, try to discredit McEwen&#39;s Pony Express riders by holding up rider Johnny Blair <a href=">Dickie Jones), who is in love with McEwen&#39;s daughter Katie (Kathlee Case&#39;). Gene and his pal Smiley (Smiley Burnette&#39;) smash the renegades and finally establish their own stage line, and Gene and which every version of &quot;Champion&#39; (Champion(II)&#39; he was riding at the moment exit after 18 years of genre-changing B-westerns. And leaving with the question of why was a name not seen before on a B-western, Ruth Woodman, credited with the story and screenplay?
Ex-Pony Express rider Autry ties to protect his US mail franchise as the Pony Express gives way to stage coach mail and the telegraph.
This final movie from America&#39;s favorite Cowboy has all the elements that made Gene Autry a legend. As always, the action, pacing and supporting cast are top-notch. It was nice to see Gene&#39;s longtime sidekick Smiley Burnette back in the saddle again in the final films of the series.<br/><br/>Even folks who are not fans of the singing cowboys will be entertained by Autry&#39;s homage to the Pony Express. <br/><br/>Autry&#39;s post-war films feature less music, more interesting story lines and appropriate budgeting. This film is no exception, ,mixing history, humor and action to create a fitting swan-song for Gene, Smiley and the World&#39;s Wonder Horse.
I wonder if Gene Autry&#39;s comment in my summary line above triggered any emotion over the fact that his own movie and TV Western career would soon be over, giving way to perhaps an even more successful business and entrepreneurial one. For Gene, this was a passing of the West tale in more ways than one, as &quot;Last of the Pony Riders&quot; wound up being his very last feature film.<br/><br/>Fittingly, Smiley Burnette&#39;s on hand for this ride into the sunset, along with Dickie Jones, a mainstay from Gene&#39;s TV show in which he portrayed various characters depending on the story line. I&#39;ve always thought that Jones was the best rider to ever don a pair of buckskins, and he shows that prowess here with a number of those mounts where he parallels his body to an already running horse, and lowers his legs, hitting the ground to catapult into the saddle. There&#39;s probably a name for that maneuver, but I&#39;ve never heard it, so you&#39;ll have to bear with that lengthy description.<br/><br/>There&#39;s something else Jones does in the picture that got my attention - he rolls his own cigarette! I only bring that up because my father used to roll his own too - his smoke of choice was Buckhorn.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, Gene&#39;s a Pony Express rider who realizes that the coming of the stage coach and telegraph spell the end of the line for his profession. Interestingly, Gene maintains a personal code that requires looking after his former employer&#39;s interest even after he&#39;s been fired for investing in a stage coach himself. Autry gives a rousing speech when it appears that Johnny Blair (Jones) is about to quit from the pressure of riding, encouraging the youngster to have faith in himself and not give up. It&#39;s the kind of message that earned Autry a place in the hearts and minds of Americans growing up, dating as far back as the Great Depression. Seems to me the country could use a few more voices today that carry the same message of faith and encouragement.
