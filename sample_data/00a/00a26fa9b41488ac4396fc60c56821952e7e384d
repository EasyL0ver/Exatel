Do you believe your ban was unjustified, if so explain why: 

Yes it was justified,I was being very immature and shouldn't of said what i said as i said 2 hours earlier that i was sorry for what i done. But then done basically the same thing after therefore it looks like i didn't care about anything or how i was being toxic to him .i have apologised to him and it wont happen again.

Why should we unban you? 

I wanna be unbanned to see things on the forums and have a look at things and hopefully come up with suggestions i am sorry for what i done 
and it will not happen again.
