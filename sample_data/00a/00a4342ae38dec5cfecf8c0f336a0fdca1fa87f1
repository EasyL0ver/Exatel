# Branch Managment

## How to create a branch

```cmd
git branch my-branch
```

## How to use the new branch or move to another branch

```cmd
git checkout my-branch
```

## How to list all the branches

```cmd
git branch
```

## How to push the new branch

```cmd
git push -u origin my-branch
```

## How to list remote branches

```cmd
git branch -a
```

## How to list all the branches that have been merged into the current branch (locally and remotely)

```cmd
git branch --merged
git branch -a --merged
```

## How to merge a branch

We need to follow the next steps:

```cmd
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git branch --merged
git merge my-branch
git push origin master
```

## How to delete a branch (local and remote)

The first command will delete `my-branch` branch locally and the next one remotely and prune it from the list

```cmd
git branch -d my-branch
git branch -d -r origin/my-branch
```

## How to prune branches from remote list

```cmd
git remote prune origin
```
If we want to see which branches will be prune without actually prune them run this instead

```cmd
git remote prune origin --dry-run
```


## How to save uncommited changes
If you need to move to another branch and don't want to commit unfinished work or you realized you're working int he wrong branch and need to move the changes so  you can use the stash command
```cmd
git stash save(optional)
```
To apply the changes on the branch you want without deleting the changes.

```cmd
git stash apply
```
To apply the changes on the branch you want deleting the changes.

```cmd
git stash pop
```

To discard the changes.

```cmd
git stash drop
```
