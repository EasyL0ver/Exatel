Gear rewamp suggestion:
Everyone starts with basic gear which is permanent and not replaceable. All current stats that can be on gear is there from the start. So let say basic weapon has on it crit/power/dex/con/agi.

How gear leveling would work:
Players still gonna get gear drops as now, just they will use that gear to feed they permanent gear. Only same type of item can be used for feeding e.x. weapon on weapon, helm on helm. 

Hows feeding gonna work:
Stats on gear that u gonna use for feeding would matter. Let say its normal gear with crit and agi, after feeding that normal gear it will provide to that specific gear crit and agi xp. Everytime stat gets enough xp to level up it improve that stat base amount. Higher rarity items would give more xp. Rerolling prices should be lowered big time + stat lock introduced. This could open whole new strategy level to pendoria where ppl donâ€™t just go blind with feeding but also care what stat they feed also it could bring constant sink.

Hows rarities gonna work:
Each gear u feed contributes towards rarity levels once rarity level ups it gives that gear 1% multiplier to stats, I would sorta like it if its not just basis>normal>rare>epic>.. instead its like basic+1>basic+2>basis+100>normal+1>etc..

Prefixes:
Gear unlocks prefixes with first runic feed. U get prefix correspondingly on what runic prefix was used. First time its +2% every other runic is +0.1%. Prefix reroll might be interesting thing too for strategy roads. Runic in base drop table might be op, but if it can be only refined from legendary it might be good and also keep refinery healthy.

Damage and protection:
I would almost considering that part removed and base damage/armor be used there instead.

Implementation:
Obviously rewamping gear like this would put everyone on lower mobs and tsers on lower gains. To avoid that as much as possible two options would be given for players, use old gear or new one. Lets say giving 3month duration till old system is wiped from the game. Newly dropped gear cant be scrapped and only post update gear can be used for feeding.
