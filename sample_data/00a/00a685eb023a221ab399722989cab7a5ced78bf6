Dedication is a very important trait that all people have although not everyone uses to its full extent. In college it’s crucial to have dedication whether your dedicated to graduating or just finishing your next assignment dedication keeps you on the right track. It is incredibly easy to get distracted while working on something and start procrastinating which will make it harder for you to finish anything. Dedication is not just being able to stay on track it’s also how you handle setbacks and whatever life throws at you that may slow your progress towards success. Not losing sight of your goals and having that commitment you need will push you towards your success that you want. Without dedication getting anything done would take you longer and more than likely decrease the quality of your work because there is no commitment to getting it done. The real world can be tough and getting your dream job may be a very rigorous process that requires you to apply multiple times before you get accepted or are able to get an interview. Once you reach your goals set a new goal something to keep you striving for, because getting comfortable is easy and getting comfortable means you are less likely to pursue new things. Setting large goals and breaking them down in to baby steps is the one of the easiest ways to remain dedicated because you are able to see the progress you are making which can be very motivating. Don’t give up if you don't see the results you are hoping for stay committed and see it through to the end.
