Mokosen - A tattered strip of cloth ripped from the fabric of reality.

Mokosen holds a handful of realms. Kapara is the first of these realms to exist and closely resembles earth, after it come the Dark Realm Satar and the Hallowed Realm of Reja.

Reja is the 'Heaven' of Mokosen. Though the legions that come from Reja show no mercy to those who do not originate from the Hallowed realm. These legions -Commonly referred to as the Hallowed, Pure, Bright, or Holy Legions- constantly battle with those that try to enter Reja.

Kapara is considered to be the mortal realm of Mokosen, keeping the numerous other realms aligned so that they may not overgrow and conquer each-other. It holds vast amounts of life, and a nurturing landscape. Though the Legions of Reja and Satar constantly battle for control of Kapara's endless riches.

Satar is the 'Hell' of Mokosen. Its landscape is dark and harrowed, devoid of purity and peace. From it came the Hellmouth and Altar Legions of Mokosen. Two brutal and chaotic war-hungry legions that trample whatever stands in the way of their dark-conquest.
