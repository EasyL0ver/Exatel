Activision has announced a limited edition Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 themed Xbox 360 bundle. The bundle was designed to fit the "battle worn style" of the CoD series. It sports a Xbox 360 console with a massive 320 GB hard drive, two wireless Call of Duty themed Xbox 360 controllers, and a copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. In addition to the console you also get a one month Xbox Live Gold subscription as well as exclusive avatar items to show off that you own this MW3 console. To make the console even more amazing, the system will play custom Call of Duty sounds, like the Night Vision powerup, when you turn the console on or eject a disc.Â 

The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Xbox 360 bundle will launch on November 8 for $399.99, and you can now pre-order the bundle at participating retailers.
