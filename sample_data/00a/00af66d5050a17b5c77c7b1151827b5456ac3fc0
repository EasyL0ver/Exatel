Name: Arcturus Rosewood
Age: 22
Gender: Male
Species: Human
Appearance: https://imgur.com/a/TErenmm
Affiliation: Bad
School: Former Atlas Student
Occupation: Contractor - Former Huntsman
 
Weapon: A pair of revolvers that transform into a pair long daggers.
Semblance: Vampire - The senblance allows Arcturus to drain another person's aura over time, potentially depleting it and leaving them defenseless for an extended period of time, while at the same time feeling his own Aura.
Drawbacks/Limitations: Arcuturus' semblance requires physical contact, either directly or indirectly. An example of indirectly would be, a stabbed target. So long as the dagger was making contact and Arcturus was holding the weapon, he could activate the semblance 
 
Personality: In a few words, Arcturus is cold, calculating, and takes pride in the refined way he conducts his symphonies of work. Though he is known to have a bit of fiery temper buried under all his composure, it's typically expressed in his "interrogation" efforts.

History: Arcturus grew up in a proud military household, but such a household also held high standards of conduct, which he found far too restricting, resulting in serious issues with authority, and ultimately in his getting barred from military service. Coming from a distinguished family meant his academy days were the most strenuous they could be to prepare him for a life as a career soldier. Jin however, had other plans. Once Arcturus was freed of the shackles of Atlas, he travelled the world, honing his skills and selling them to the highest bidder. What did he do? Killed hunstmen and huntresses, of course. Alongside dealing with Grimm infestations, of course. Money's money after all, regardless of the job.

Trivia: Arcturus has a fine taste, and as a result, an expensive taste. Thus, his prices aren't cheap either. But he tends to go the extra mile for well-paying customers.
