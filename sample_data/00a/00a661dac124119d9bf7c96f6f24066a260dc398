logic behind suggestion: Death raid entry = 2 separate chances of rolling raids piece (4 with double loot, which everyone has) with an entry cost of 50T (most expensive method) and a 1:33 drop rate on death chests

33X50T = 1650T

- Raid piece averages out to be 8Q each (10 piece set/pc price) ((4.8Q in item grinder)) which that itself alone is enough to profit  from raids unless you somehow manage to go over 140 dry

- Raid pieces also roll on their own separate drop table which means currently you can still roll 1Q+ items WHILE getting a raid piece.

- Current maxed raid teams run approximately 15-20 minute raids but we'll say 3.5 raids an hour just to be safe. With the current droprates excluding double loots you should be making (on average) 750T per hour from raid items alone (excluding aforementioned drops)

- No other droptable on imagine currently rivals this aside from multi bosses with a huge mass, and those are few and far in between.

- These ultra rare drops need to be removed or replaced with more lower tier items because lowering the drop rates just won't do it until you lower them into the ground enough, and at that point no one's gonna do raids, and no one's gonna be paying  for death raid skips (which lets be real, all you care about is $$$ right? so fuck it as long as raids is this busted you'll just keep buffing raids until people donate for max. Pay to win is pretty cool)

- content generally has a niche reason why it's done, QBD is farmed for the QBD (set oh wait that got ruined by raids. dead content)

People would spend donator points on raiden/dark raiden sets (oh, you can just do raids to get those pieces now. there goes some money)

Raids should have one niche reason, and that should be the raid set, there should be no incentive other than BIS gear (because the gear is BIS)

And to top if all off this content is easier than ever to access, because some absolute fucking nobhead thought it'd be a good idea to make you able to donate to be able to skip to the best content ingame, so you don't even have to grind to get here, just donate instead! good idea! (this isn't relevant to the proposed nerf but i needed to vent somewhere that this is an absolute fucking shite idea)


pros: economy saved yet again by mike

cons: u lose revenue because people are less likely to donate for raid skips 


tl;dr: remove the ultra rares table because you still make enough money without it
