                    <p>An inkling that was unfortunately trapped in a spawn point for years after it had malfunctioned while she was respawning from a spawn point. Thankfully, she was saved by an Octoling engineer named Connie.
</p>
                    <p>Prior the incident, Dia had long, vibrant orange colored tentacles, matching orange eyes, and fair skin. She wore the basic headband, tee, and cream basics. An unfashionable or "unfresh" set, but it’s the first gear she was gifted at the start of her turfing career.</p>

<p>When she became trapped within the spawn point, her body became drippy and glitch-like. Her voice often came out as gargled auto-tuned garbage, sputtery and choppy. It was a painful experience to be stuck in limbo, between life and death. She bawled almost nonstop.</p>

<p>After her rehabilitation, her colors became desaturated: She became pale, almost ghastly, and her tentacles seemed to be a softer orange color. Her body also changed significantly, becoming noticeably smaller in stature, frailer, and her tentacles shrunk, all to accommodate for the large amount of natural ink she lost in the procedure.</p>

<p>Even after her extensive recovery, she still seems...rather off for an Inkling; her voice often has uncontrollable, glitchy outbursts, but they usually pass off as quirky burps. Along with that anomaly, she withholds this ability to...teleport, in a sense? In turf wars, she’s practically untouchable. Even if you believe you’ve got her, she’s right behind you and lands a splat for her team. It almost seems like lag in video games. No one has caught onto her yet, but this condition of her most definitely shouldn’t make her eligible to compete in turf wars...</p>

                    <p>‪During one of Dia’s first turf war matches, a power outage occurred, the first reporting of an incident like this. As she was splatted and about to respawn, the spawn point malfunctioned, causing her not to reappear even after the power was restored. At the realization, the match was cancelled, panic erupted from the spectators, and close ones rushed to the scene to see if their loved one was still present. The news crew stormed the scene, alongside skilled mechanics who knew how spawn points worked. Despite the hours they tried tampering with the spawn, nothing brought Dia back; they were at a complete loss and unfortunately had to call it quits and notify her family about her presumed death. As a result of the incident, the stage in question, Bluefin Depot, was shut down for public use, and abandoned.‬‬</p>
                    
                    <p>‪Months past before Dia reappeared from the spawn, and when she noticed she’s been freed, she also notices what’s happened to her body; her entire being is glitching in a pixelated mess, her voice distorted... In her panic she pops, proofing out of existence and returning her to the spawn point once again. This warping in and out of reality irregularly plagues Dia for years, tearing down her mental state significantly. She was lonely and afraid, afraid she’ll loop like this forever.‬</p>
