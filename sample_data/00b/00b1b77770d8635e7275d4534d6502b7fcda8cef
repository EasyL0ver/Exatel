the me too movement is nothing more than political validation for a womans fantasies of being raped and a tool to extort money from rich men.

once it starts with a most proficient story, then more and more women begin to hoard their fantasies within the group adding more and more absurd pressure to the possibly innocent person involved. they go though extreme measures and they most likely believe they are spiritually guided or atleast have a sense of unhonest justice and scammist/pyramid scheme of undeniably sexually desperate eloquence in exchange for payment as a form of "cleansing"
