_Jessie glanced at the redhead, and smiled, eyes sparkling as then in a flash of lightning, rain began to descend upon them. Jess ducked her head, squeezing her reigns to barely contain her pulsing joy. The trio gallivanted off, rushing through the outskirts of towns and trees, until they were miles and miles from the castle. The rain was perfect in making them harder to spot, and after the first mile they had all but completely lost sight of any pursuers. Her heart was pounding as she veered off towards the forest, and brought them deep into the woods, before slowing to a stop at the outskirts of a clearing. She stumbled, tripping off her horse as she slammed into the ground in her rush near the center of the field. She pressed her palms against the wild grass blades, Looking down at them as her chest swelled, she shook, trembling as huge, overwhelming bouts of laughter tore through her chest. Squeezing her eyes until she too tossed her head back in a flash of wet black tendrils, shouting as loud as possible, yelling her happiness to the growling sky "God yes!! GOD YES!!!" she cried, and then turned when Polaire and Travers got off their horses. She ran over to the, tears pricking her eyes as she smiled, her eyes flashing as she blindly scooped Polaire into her arms in a fierce hug. "WE DID IT" she sobbed, lifting the redhead off the ground her her joy, spinning them in her grasp._
