Cosmic resistance from black holes: A highway in space.

Gravity causes resistance to us while we're on earth, near earth, near the moon, within our solar system from the sun, and in a galaxy from a black hole at the center of the galaxy. This applies more resistance to our motors, or engines, causing them to need more energy, to achieve the same amount of work.

The moon's field diameter ranges close to the distance the moon is from the earth, the earth's field's diameter ranges from the distance from earth, to the moon, the sun's fields diameter ranges all the way out to Pluto, and a bit beyond, and the black hole at the center of the milky way's field's diameter ranges out to the furthest edge of the milky way galaxy.

The space in between galaxies, given no stars, or other cosmic bodies, would have less resistance, than being inside a solar system, or inside a galaxy. So this space in between galaxies, that separate galaxies, would be like a highway of super-efficientness for our motors, or engines, making our motors, or engines, use less energy, to do the same amount of work.

This space, in between galaxies would be very helpful for humanity, becuase our motors, or engines could use less energy, to do the same amount of work, or essentially, give us longer range with our spacecraft's propulsions, by traveling deep space, in the space between galaxies, instead of traveling through a galaxy itself.
