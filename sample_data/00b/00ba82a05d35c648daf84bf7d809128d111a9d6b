"Ugh..." A groan rang thru the room as something emerged from Mira's bed. "The hell did I do last night...?"

She slowly looked down at herself, seeing cream-colored breasts. "...What the fuck?" Mira then sobered up and began to inspect her body. Her antennae were gone, her skin was now white instead of blue, and her tail was now gone.

She ran out onto the patio, breathing hard. "I'M A MONSTER!"

"I am not in the mood, dude!" Mira ran back inside, panting. "Gotta calm down... gotta find a way to go back to normal..."

"Why would you want to be normal?" A shadowy figure appeared behind her, causing her to scream loudly. "You look so beautiful..."

"You did this!" Mira screeched and lunged at the figure angrily. "Change me back, you asshole!"

"Oh, silly Mira. This is what you were all along. You are the humans." The figure's good fell off to reveal a skeleton. "Hahahahaha!"

Mira woke up screaming, covered in sweat.  She looked around and all over herself, back to her normal blue self. "Oh, thank gawd... I am never drinking beer and eating candy together ever again..."
