#### MiniLab: Go Home, Leave, and Get Back

In this quick exercise, you will practice opening the terminal, entering a few commands to navigate around the file system, and inspect the current working directory and its contents

- First, open the the terminal using the commands listed above
- Next, type `pwd <Enter>` and look at the `output` of the command.  What is the current working directory?  Is the format of the output an absolute or relative path?
- Type `cd <Enter>`.  Repeat the previous step.  Is the current working directory the same or different?
- Type `ls <Enter>`.  What files and directories are in the current working directory? (*Hint*: for a slightly different format of the output from `ls` try adding the `-l` *flag*: `ls -l`)
- Navigate to the `Desktop` by typing `cd ~/Desktop <Enter>`.  Verify that the current working directory is, in fact, the `Desktop` using `pwd`.
- Inspect the contents of the `Desktop` directory by typing `ls -l`.  What do you see?
- If you know that there is a directory inside the Desktop, try to navigate to it using `cd` and inspect its contents
- *Challenge*: Navigate back to the `Home` directory, i.e., the directory we went to by typing `cd <Enter>` above, using relative paths and `../<directory name>`
- Finally, close the terminal by pressing `<Command> + W` (tap both keys at the same time)
