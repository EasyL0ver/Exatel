For example, if I took a few chemistry classes, would I be able to synthesize and create different chemicals myself (if I had the proper equipment) or is it all theoretical or book work. I would like to create and separate chemicals at home, but I don't know where to start. How can I find classes that would give me experience and not just theoretical book work?
