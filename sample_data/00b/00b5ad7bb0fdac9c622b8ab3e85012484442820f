[20:30:21] << Tom The Barkeep >> Have you run the /guide textbooks command yet?
[20:30:29] << Tom The Barkeep >> Hmmm... wait a second....
[20:30:31] * Tom The Barkeep pulls out a note that was crumpled into a ball. * 
[20:30:39] << Tom The Barkeep >> Ah! Miss Annabelle told me you might be coming this way...
[20:30:49] << Tom The Barkeep >> She said you might need help getting to Diagon....

[20:30:54] [Quests] So.... you're who I am looking for right?
[20:30:54] [Yep that's me!]
[20:30:54] ✔ [Oooo! Diagon Alley?! Where is it?]
[20:30:54] [Sorry, not me mate!]

[20:33:08] << Tom The Barkeep >> Well, diagon is right behind me, but hold on now...

[20:33:13] [Quests] are you the kid I am looking for?
[20:33:13] ✔ [Yep that's me!]
[20:33:13] [Oooo! Diagon Alley?! Where is it?]

[20:33:17] << Tom The Barkeep >> Oh! Good!
[20:33:18] << Tom The Barkeep >> That's a relief, because it's been starting to look mighty odd, me approaching small children...
[20:33:31] << Tom The Barkeep >> Anyway... I am sure you're very excited to be going to Hogwarts.
[20:33:38] << Tom The Barkeep >> I remember, when I was your age.... well that was a long time ago..
[20:33:45] << Tom The Barkeep >> Well.. let me just get that-- err map that Miss Annabelle gave me.
[20:33:51] *  Tom The Barkeep feels up his pockets, front, back, jacket, then blushes scarlet. * 
[20:33:58] << Tom The Barkeep >> Oh dear... it seems... oh don't tell Miss Annabelle that I lost your map... I doubt she would be angry, but I wouldn't want her to know I can't be helping her the right way....
[20:34:16] << Tom The Barkeep >> Okay, here's an idea.
[20:34:18] << Tom The Barkeep >> Why don't you do /guide textbooks .
[20:34:26] << Tom The Barkeep >> That will bring you right to Miss Annabelle, a bright yellow line should appear on the ground.
[20:34:35] << Tom The Barkeep >> So why not do that now, then talk to me again.
[20:34:41] << Tom The Barkeep >> Very good! Ver-ree Good!
[20:34:43] << Tom The Barkeep >> I am so glad you figured out that command.
[20:34:48] << Tom The Barkeep >> You can also do /guidelist to see all the locations that you might want to go to.
[20:35:02] << Tom The Barkeep >> Make sure you are in the location that they start in though, otherwise you might not see the trail!
[20:35:23] << Tom The Barkeep >> Well, better get on yer way!
[20:35:25] << Tom The Barkeep >> Miss Annabelle isn't going to wait around all day! Oh wait... before you go! You need the texture pack.
[20:35:38] << Tom The Barkeep >> It can either be gotten automatically by running the command /texture hogwarts or by downloading it from textures.knockturnmc.com.
[20:35:52] << Tom The Barkeep >> If you need assistance from staff, you can also always do /helpop YOUR QUESTION HERE.
[20:36:00] << Tom The Barkeep >> Now off to see Miss Annabelle!
[20:38:02] << Miss Annabelle >> Oh hello there young one!
[20:38:04] << Miss Annabelle >> My name is Annabelle, but many people call me Miss Annabelle.
[20:38:11] *  Miss Annabelle blushes. * 
[20:38:12] << Miss Annabelle >> Only because Tom calls me that.
[20:38:15] << Miss Annabelle >> Tom really is quite kind.... so sad about his late uncle though, whom he was named after.
[20:38:24] << Miss Annabelle >> Well then, let me look, I have it right here in my notes.
[20:38:37] *  Miss Annabelle glances down at a notebook emblazen with the symbol for ravenclaw. * 
[20:38:44] << Miss Annabelle >> Yes, yes, here it is, your pare--- err guardian.
[20:38:49] << Miss Annabelle >> Sorry dear, are they your parent... you know.
[20:38:53] *  Miss Annabelle looks up with a sympathetic smile. * 
[20:38:57] << Miss Annabelle >> It truly doesn't matter, to each their own.
[20:39:01] << Miss Annabelle >> They told me you would need some help getting about Diagon Alley.
[20:39:10] << Miss Annabelle >> Now I have a list of places you should visit, and we can do it in any order, whatever you like.
[20:39:20] << Miss Annabelle >> However, since you are here, (and this is my favorite part), we get to pick out your school books.
[20:39:29] << Miss Annabelle >> Oh, but you know, I actually have some galleons here that your ...guardian...
[20:39:42] *  Miss Annabelle stumbles over the word, as if she is worried to offend. * 
[20:39:48] << Miss Annabelle >> Well, they left me some pocket change for you to purchase your books with.
[20:39:55] << Miss Annabelle >> Oh and I have a book for you that you might like...
[20:40:01] << Miss Annabelle >> It will help you with identifying what you might be working on (just right click it to see your current quests)
[20:40:19]  -- You received 5 Galleons from the quest! --
[20:40:20]  -- You just received an item from the quest! --
[20:40:20] << Miss Annabelle >> Okay then dear...
[20:40:21] << Miss Annabelle >> Now you do not require all the textbooks, but you do need the Standard Book of Spell Grade 1 & 2.
[20:40:31] << Miss Annabelle >> You need both, as they are not based on your year in school, but based on the grade of the spells.
[20:40:41] << Miss Annabelle >> Now then... to buy the books, first right click the sign before me.
[20:40:54] << Miss Annabelle >> This sign is a shop sign, and in side you will be able to see all the books Flourish and Blotts currently offers.
[20:41:06] << Miss Annabelle >> After you buy the first two books, you can choose to buy the others.
[20:41:40] << Miss Annabelle >> Very good!
[20:41:41] << Miss Annabelle >> I am so very glad you were able to find them!
[20:41:46] << Miss Annabelle >> I love the smell of new books, they just make my day.
[20:41:51] << Miss Annabelle >> Now, I have a great list of places to go, but outside of my list there are some shops that you might like to visit: The Magical Menagerie, Mulpepper's Apothecary, Quality Quidditch Supplies, Florean's Icecream Parlor, and Madam Malkins.
[20:42:15] << Miss Annabelle >> However, you can also come back and visit them later!
[20:42:20] << Miss Annabelle >> /spawn will bring you back to Diagon Alley in a heart beat, and of course taking the floo to 'great hall' brings you back to Hogwarts, ONCE YOU ARE SORTED, of course!
[20:42:37] << Miss Annabelle >> So... on with the list!
[20:42:39] << Miss Annabelle >> Okay then!

[20:42:40] [Quests] What's next?
[20:42:40]  ✔ [I want to get my wand!]
[20:42:40] [I would like to see Gringotts!]
[20:42:40] [I want to know about floo/portkeys!]
[20:42:40] [I want to visit Weasley Wizard Wheezes!]
[20:42:40] [I want writing supplies!]

[20:42:48] << Miss Annabelle >> Oh yes! Getting your wand is the most exciting thing!
[20:42:53] << Miss Annabelle >> You have to go to Ollivander's, just right down the alley and take a right at Gringotts.
[20:43:05] << Miss Annabelle >> If you get lost, you can always do /spawn & do /guide ollivanders.
[20:43:11] << Miss Annabelle >> You should talk to my friend Claire when you get there.
[20:43:17] << Miss Annabelle >> She will tell you how to get a wand.... and she better be keeping her hands off Mr. Ollivander's grandson too!
[20:44:11] << Claire >> Oh.... Who are you?
[20:44:13] << Claire >> OH! Let me guess! Annabelle sent you.
[20:44:20] << Claire >> Well you should tell her to keep her nose out of other people's business. I am JUST buying a wand. There is no harm in that!

[20:44:33] [Quests] Now scram! I don't need one of Annabelle's hovering spies!
[20:44:33]  ✔ [I am not here for that, I am here to get a wand.]
[20:44:33] [Annabelle said you should leave Mr. Ollivander's grandson alone!]
[20:44:33] [You shouldn't assume things! That's just plain rude.]

[20:44:42] << Claire >> Oooooh~ ! A wand!
[20:44:44] << Claire >> Oh yes, that I can help with.
[20:44:47] << Claire >> You see, I am absolutely obsessed with wands... and wandlore... and... well yes.
[20:44:55] << Claire >> I want so badly to work for the ollivanders, but you see it's a family run business... and Mr. Ollivander is quite strict on that....
[20:45:09] << Claire >> So a wand! If you want to get a wand you just need you talk to Mr. Ollivander!
[20:45:16] << Claire >> (Right Click Him) and ask to try a wand.
[20:45:20] << Claire >> He will hand you one wand for one wand ticket.
[20:45:25] << Claire >> After that you hold the wand in your hand, then right click.
[20:45:31] << Claire >> If it turns back to a wand ticket, that wand didn't choose you.
[20:45:37] << Claire >> Remember, the wand chooses the witch, and it's not always clear why.
[20:45:44] << Claire >> Okay then! Go talk to Mr. Ollivander
[20:45:48] << Claire >> And come show me your wand after
[20:45:51] *  Claire looks embarrassed * 
[20:45:53] << Claire >> I have to see....
[20:46:18] << Claire >> Have you tried a wand from Mr. Ollivander yet? Make sure you right clicked while holding the wand after!
[20:50:20] [SpellCore] Your wand power is at 100%
[20:50:21] [SpellCore] Wand raised
[20:50:24] << Claire >> Oh my!
[20:50:24] << Claire >> That is a nice wand!
[20:50:26] << Claire >> I wish I had one like this... but then again, I wish I owned every wand.
[20:50:34] << Claire >> They are truly fascinating....
[20:50:43] << Claire >> if only Mr. Ollivander would let me into his family or work for him....
[20:50:50] << Claire >> NO! I am not harassing his grandson...
[20:50:54] << Claire >> It's not harassment if he likes it.
[20:50:57] *  Claire smiles in a way that looks just a bit disturbing. * 
[20:51:03] << Claire >> Well, it looks like that's all you need from Mr. Ollivander.
[20:51:09] << Claire >> Just remember that wands have gifts/curses of their own, and they are different from what you might be good at.
[20:51:22] << Claire >> Don't worry though, you can overcome any curse.... and truly it's just speculation at this point.
[20:51:31] << Claire >> Also, your wand will work better for you than someone else's wand would, and the more you cast, the more your wand will have an affinity with
