Fresh on the scene its a lovely ass day
In my baby blue jays as i glide the cwalk boys saving up ball ye just, to ball
One, day
But im year round best believe at the end of april imma put it down
Posse up the d-town fill the rooms with (?)
Run the x pill smoke 'diene and the herb
Swang in the 'burb
Hang in the 3rd
Boys got (?) all on the curb
They got the slabs out so the streets full of glass
Hoes and (?) got the rest full of ass
Im all about my cash so i just wanna look got a girl at the house thats real cute can cook
Warfare off the hook like a fucked up phone
Hangin lights out the roof representin acres home
Its on. its on
I hope the party dont stop
I dont really think it is cuz every body bout to drop
Go and do it like its hot its a 1 time bang Monday back to work
Yep same all thang 
Hol up man they done got too crunk 
They did party so hard that the flagship sunk
It done hit a iceberg
Just like Titanic 
But it was just my unit so it aint no need to panic
Shit got damaged now im fucked up cant manage (?)
