<p>"This isn't fair," she said to her young mother. At the age of nine, it would be expected that she grew out of her selfish, bratty phase. However, due to holding an odd disdain for her fourteen year old sister Grace, that behavior stuck like a stain on white clothing. Her poor mother had to deal with Violet's whining while helping her benevolent eldest through middle school.</p>
<p>Violet didn't understand Grace. She was so nice. Even when Violet was mean, her sister wouldn't fight back. Her confusion with life as she saw it was all piled into one person, in the form of Grace. </p>
<p>It wasn't until Violet turned eleven that she began to really show the care she held for her sister. Grace was put in charge of babysitting Violet more often. She took care of her little sister. Grace always say Violet as her baby sister. She wanted to be good to her. Their mother had begun working two jobs and Violet had never known her father, leaving no choice for Grace anyway. The girls' mother was a ray of sunshine and the apple didn't fall far from the tree with Grace. Violet never really realized this until she was forced to see it.</p>
<p>One night, when Grace was in charge and their mother was working, Violet was teaching herself some card game. She was eleven, Grace had just turned seventeen a few weeks prior. Of course, not all of Violet's ignorance and childishness had faded. There was still very much a spark of fire within her that disliked her sister. So, what does a younger sibling do when they don't know any better? Nag their sibling about a break-up. Yes, of course.</p>
<P>Unfortunately, her sister and her boyfriend had broken up just a week before her birthday. The wound was still fresh. But Violet didn't know any better. She thought she was just teasing. But easing led to an argument, an argument led yelling, and yelling led to crying. The younger of both was the loudest. Harsh words were exchanged. Even in such a heated situation, Grace still took her namesake and never insulted or said something she knew would harm Violet. Violet couldn't say the same.</p>
<P>Grace left that night, at around seven o'clock, just after the screaming-match finished. "I'm going for a ride," she said. That always meant she was taking her cruiser bike out for a while. Violet had tears in her eyes. She didn't know why. Was she feeling bad for making her sister run off? Why couldn't she understand it? Eventually, she cooled down and went about her routine of watching the television or playing a game on their computer. She wasn't nervous about being alone for an hour, which was typically the time Grace was gone when she went for a ride. Violet had been left alone that long before.</p>
<p>An hour turned into two hours. It seemed like time was an eternity. It wasn't real. Two hours turned into three. Surely, Grace would be back.</p>
<p>But she wouldn't. She never came back. It wasn't until Violet's sobbing mother woke her up from the couch, accompanied by policemen that she knew her sister was gone.
