What about Quest Protein Bar?
Quest Bars seem to be ‘superior’ to other protein bars as they contain no added sugar or artificial sweeteners and are gluten-free (meaning people with coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity can enjoy them too). The ingredients list is also relatively short in comparison to other protein bars.
