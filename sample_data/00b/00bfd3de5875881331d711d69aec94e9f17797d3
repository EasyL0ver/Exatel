is there any so-called good time to go running? i've been jogging around 9pm because i'm shy to run in front of too many people .

so there is no such thing as "running at night is not good because the trees stop photosynthesising and release CO2 and its bad for the lungs"?

I water parade myself , then wait for 45 mins to 1hr, then jog...
I can jog anytime... I like to jog where there is alot of people. So that, I can find some1 to pace. ><

intervals of sprinting is better for fat loss.

if you still want to keep jogging, earlier morning, before breakfast is a good time, maybe can help wake you up too.

you either combine sprinting with jogging or fast walking. eg. do 30 sec of sprinting, 30 sec of jogging. you can make the times longer, but don't go over a minute each.

total time spent shouldn't be more than 15 minutes, if you are just starting off, then 4 -5 minutes may be enough, then gradually increase the time.

Look up on HIIT -- high intensity interval training.

Morning and late evening is the best time. Never in the afternoon directly under the sun. It will dehydrate you too fast and you might faint. Unless you run under shades, which still not so advisable
