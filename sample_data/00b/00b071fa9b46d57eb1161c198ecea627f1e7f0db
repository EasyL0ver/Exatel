1. As a Wraith if you're in a good spot before the next wave starts and you're chosen
as a demi boss you've lost that position

2. Attacking someone before next wave and you're chosen at demi boss you don't get your kill

3. Behind where humans are shooting as wraith or about to prop kill someone

Some people may say "just kill yourself as demi", well this puts the zombie
team at a disadvantage because they lose a demi boss

I wouldn't mind it if it wasn't forced on you while you were "alive" as a zombie, but
it's annoying to be taken away from your current position to be made a demi boss.
