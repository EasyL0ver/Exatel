1st Doctor

The goal of this collection and the ones I plan to follow up with, is to provide the most complete and comprehensive Classic Doctor Who collection on the net. Also included on the DVD releases are what are called "Production Subtitles" which are a form of text commentary that provide information on the production of the episode which may differ from the audio commentary. The initial torrent I downloaded which had all of the episodes and a good portion of the extras did have some borked files which I have replaced overtime. I do believe I've gotten them all but let me know if I've missed anything. Some of the extras I have ripped myself from the iso files, others I had ripped by friends. It has taken me some time to get it to the state of completion it is now and now I wish to make that easier for anybody else who also wants the special features or even if someone just wants quality uploads of the 1963-1989 series.

Some of you may be aware that there are missing episodes of Doctor Who, let me clarify some things: Every episode exists as audio from off air recordings. You're not going to have to skip episodes because they don't exist anymore. However, because the video does not exist anymore for many of them, there are quite a few ways these stories have been reconstructed/can be experienced. If the file does not specify that it is a reconstruction, the video is complete.

-Telesnap Reconstruction - Mostly made by Loose Canon Productions (http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Loose_Cannon_Productions) using off air snaps of the screen during the initial airing along with some captions to assist where the audio is a bit unclear. Every missing episode has atleast one of these. The BBC has also made some but they are generally considered of lesser quality - Particularly because most of them do not include clips of episodes that have actually survived where the rest of the episode has not, nor do they have captions. The files specify whether it is made by Loose Canon or the BBC in the title. I have included all available ones.

Narrated Soundtrack CDs - These are audio only reconstructions made by the BBC with narration by a cast member to assist since an audio only reconstruction cannot have captions. I have included all available soundtrack CDs, even where the episodes have been recovered. Each episode is it's own track so if it's only a partially missing story and you would like to listen to just the missing part(s), you may do so. Some of them also have interviews.

Animated Reconstructions- These are a bit crude, but they personally are the easiest to follow for me. All of the ones included here with the exception of Mission to the Unknown (which Ian Levine commissioned to have animated) are animated by the BBC. I have included all of the BBC's currently available animations. Sadly, many are not yet animated.

Novelizations - Before home media was a thing, novelizations were quite common and popular. They are, I believe, more often than not rewritten using the scripts themselves. Some of these also have unabridged audiobooks which feature sound effects and music. For stories which are half missing or more, I have included the e-book and if available, audiobook.

It is your choice as to what you feel is the best way to experience the missing episodes. More info on the missing episodes

Other notes:
-I have zipped everything so you can more easily pick and choose what you want - episodes are 1 zip, extras are another, along with any other reconstructions etc. I'd just pop it in JDownloader and remove what you don't want.

-Some Classic episodes, such as Dalek Invasion of Earth, feature optional CGI effects. I have included both the broadcast versions of those episodes and the CGI versions in seperate zips.

-The Chase has a brief segment featuring the Beatles that was removed from the NTSC DVD release. It also removes some of the bits around that segment. The rip here is from the PAL DVD so it is included. I have also included an audio file of the US commentary, which differs a bit from the UK commentary due to the lack of that portion of the episode.[/list]

-In the case of Marco Polo and Galaxy 4, there are condensed telesnap reconstructions done by the BBC. The latter actually has one surviving episode and utilizes some CGI in the reconstruction. I muxed the surviving episode out of the condensed version and put it alongside the Loose Canon reconstruction for a more complete experience.

-Loose Canon did two different versions of Marco Polo: One in black & white and one in color. I have been told that the color version actually has less telesnaps than black & white, so it would probably be better to watch without color, atleast on first viewing.

-Mission to the Unknown, a one-off missing episode, has an unofficial animation which was comissioned by Ian Levine included.

-The Daleks' Master Plan actually was split into two novelizations, the former of which also adapted "Mission to the Unknown".

-The Daleks' Master Plan also has a fan-made comic adaptation. I ripped it from kasterborous.com and packed it into a cbz file myself.

-All files should be good but if any are bad, please let me know.

-There are some extras from a DVD called "Lost in Time" for both William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton. That's where some of the episodes come from as well, for incomplete stories, but I've moved the surviving episodes to the story's folder. The extras are for that are[url=https://forum.snahp.it/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=3780]here[/url].

-There is some dispute on the numbering of the stories - I use the numbering on wikipedia as seen here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_episodes_(1963%E2%80%931989)
