Operation Trebor: Gatwick drones Two people arrested over criminal use at airport

Authorities in London announced late Friday that two arrests have been made in their investigation of unauthorized drone flights at Gatwick, Britain's second busiest airport. And one key eye-witness has told police he saw a cyclist 'frantically' packing away two drones away on a country lane near the airport. The airport was plunged into chaos on Wednesday night when drones spotted hovering near the runway forced hundreds of flights to be cancelled, delaying and stranding thousands of passengers. After speculation the successful bid to bring utter chaos to Gatwick was the work of eco-terrorists police finally arrested two suspects 'in the Gatwick area' just after 10pm last night.
