WARNING: The following is an early draft of an official SCP report. All details may be compromised and should not be taken as objective reality.

SCP-4956: NOWL for you 
Class: Euclid (Uncontained)

Special Containment Procedures: 
As the effect is only limited to 4956-1 and does not appear to be able to spread, no special efforts by the Foundation is required at this time. However, Mobile Task Force SHD-0-40 is to remain on lookout for any temporal disturbances consistent with SCP-4956's effects. When a possible 4956 candidate is found, MTF SHD-0-40 is to implement Protocol Sandbag to attempt to bring in 4956-1.
Once 4956-1 is contained, he is to be contained in a standard humanoid steel containment cell, with the excpetion of the replacement of the keypad with a manual tumbler-key lock, and provided with all reasonable requests which do not involve watching, listening to, or otherwise engaging with an Overwatch League broadcast. No complex devices such as laptops or cellphones are to be allowed within a 5m radius of 4956-1's cell, and absolutely no devices capable of measuring the passage time are to be allowed within this radius.
Testing regarding 4956-1 must not involve measurement of time without 3 properly calibrated Scranton Reality Anchors set up according to Protocol TriHard 7 with 4956-1 acting as the focal point. 4956-1 is not considered physically dangerous and as such, once contained, will only require 2 normal guard personnel outside of his cell.

Description: SCP-4956 is a temporal anomaly centering around online account MrPhish21, henceforth referred to as 4956-1, and the ongoing Overwatch League, produced by Blizzard. The anomaly occurs whenever a match is about to being and 4956-1 expresses desire to watch the match. 
At that time, all timekeeping devices will fail catastrophically, resulting in 4956-1 missing the event he desired to observe. Attempts to contact 4956-1 to remind him of the match he desired to watch will also somehow fail, with automated systems somehow failing to complete their tasks and humans either forgetting or becoming otherwise engaged until the match has passed.
The Foundation first became aware of 4956's presence through Online Agent [REDACTED] who became aware of anomalous behavior through an online chat service known as Discord. OA [REDACTED] contacted the Foundation, but due to 4956's effects having corrupted electronic logs, the Foundation have been unable to secure 4956-1's exact location. Doctor Miller has hypothesized that the Foundation has located 4956-1 in the past, but been thwarted when 4956-1 used his anomalous abilities to alter the flow of time and essentially warp reality to a timeline where the Foundation has not found 4956-1 yet. Thus, it is unclear if the Foundation will ever succeed in securing 4956-1.

Additional Notes:
[LEVEL 3 CLEARANCE CREDENTIALS ACCEPTED - Welcome [REDACTED]]
Dr. Miller: The above page is slightly inaccurate, but this is merely to avoid panic. The truth is, 4956 eludes even our best abilities to anchor reality. Even SRAs don't seem to negate its effects. We've been able to retroactively observe 4956's effects via heavy anti-reality-warping filtering, but so far we've been unable to proactively prevent 4956 from altering reality and the flow of time.
The consequences of our failure are concerning. Hume readings show that the timeline we occupy is slowly destabilizing with each 4956 occurrence, and if left unchecked, 4956 could potentially prevent us from percieving the universe in a sensible manner. Or, perhaps, that point has already been reached.
