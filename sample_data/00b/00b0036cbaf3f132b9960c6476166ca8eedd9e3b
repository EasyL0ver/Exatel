Following the death of his parents and little brother, Mike LeRoi is transformed by a voodoo priestess into a guardian of the afterlife, or Deadside, known as Shadow Man. Not long after, an ancient demon called Legion plots to take over Deadside by taking control of malevolent entities called Dark Souls. Only Shadow Man can stand in his way...
Cryptic action adventure about the undead voodoo warrior known as the Shadow Man who must stop Jack the Ripper and the biblical demon called Legion who plan to bring about the apocalypse using the souls of five notorious serial killers.
A dark, atmospheric, creepy, sometimes scary adventure filled with Horror settings, characters, soundtrack, and creepy fun factor.<br/><br/>&quot;Shadowman&quot; starts pretty good with some intense cinema action and is followed with how Legion is corrupting the most famous serial killers. Excellent plot that will leave you breathless and wanting for more.<br/><br/>At first, &quot;Shadowman&quot; is difficult but the more you play, the more you get hooked in. The plot gets your attention and makes you wanna play it at night.<br/><br/>The graphics are superb and creepy. The settings are extremely well done. Specially the Underworld and the Prison stage. The soundtrack is chilling and filled with great sounds.<br/><br/>Please, give this game a try if you are into Horror Survival. This game has probably the best plot in recent years.
For Role Playing Games, this one has lots of capabilities. You can be all sorts of characters throughout the game if you wish, and the camera and 3D functions are very good. The environments, drawings, worlds that you are operating in and out of are just marvelous. So good are the asylums, caves, swamps, prisons, houses, and especially enemies that I am still imitating them and wishing for a battle with them almost daily - even though I haven&#39;t played the game in over 4 years! The chainsaw wielding, machete swinging, rock throwing enemies are simply outrageous and so fun to see chasing and attacking you that getting through them doesn&#39;t even matter. I could care less if I got killed since doing battle was so darned fun! There are flying pterodactyls throwing acid eggs, zombies wandering around trying to zap your life-force energy, as well as typical enemies with multiple types of firearms aimed against you. You&#39;ll hear Hannibal Lecter type slurping noises from the funny looking half-skeletons that are spitting wads of death at you while calling your name in taunting zombie voices. So many freaky and unusual enemies just make this game continuously exciting and amusing.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed this game more than anything else I&#39;ve done. It became my primary goal in life, getting time on the computer to play Shadowman. Even still my wife and I imitate the creepily funny sounds that the characters made, an amazing array of screams, grunts, taunts and eerie callings! This game has such an immense level of tasks and challenges as well as an equal number of differing characters to battle that you never grow tired of the next rung. Only true fault is that some levels might be navigated quickly by experienced roll players, and they may unfortunately finish earlier than desired. I was really sad that it had to end. I wish it would just keep on going!<br/><br/>Admittedly, the vocal track of the main character (you) is a bit slow and overdone and comes off sort of lame, and the concept of traveling to/from life and the underworld &quot;deadside&quot; also far-fetched. But accepting that concept and diving into the character becomes such an overwhelmingly fun experience who needs spend money on drugs, alcohol, movies, etc, etc. <br/><br/>I will add that as I review this years later, that by modern standards of HD gaming, the graphics may be a bit dated, but still very good. For the time, they are top notch! To play this game years later, it still has enough realism and detail that you will feel fully engaged and entranced into this underworld.<br/><br/>Why don&#39;t they make an XP version or patch I don&#39;t know. I have never heard anyone talking of this game so perhaps it didn&#39;t do too well, even I got it on big discount. The XP compatibility wizard doesn&#39;t work either, so I don&#39;t know how to relive my Shadowman other than finding another old windows 98 computer. I gave my old one away during a move before I knew it didn&#39;t work on the new XP. Hope anyone reading this can have the fun I did, it is great!! I don&#39;t even know if anyone will ever see this review since I just stumbled onto the VG section of IMDb. I hope that people do find this review, as the game Shadowman is far and away the most addicting and fun all consuming game I have ever used. And I have spent years gaming.
