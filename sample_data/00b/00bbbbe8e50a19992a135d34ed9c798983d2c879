Pumpkin Pie

Crust:
(any shortening-based pie crust recipe will do, or premade)
1 1/2 cup flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup vegetable shortening
1/4 cup ice cold water

Filling:
1 3/4 cups roasted and pureed pumpkin, or 15 oz can
2/3 cup (130 grams) granulated sugar
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp cinammon
1 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp ground clove
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1 1/3 cup heavy cream
3 eggs


Preheat oven to 400 F

Crust:
Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in shortening in small chunks using a pastry blender or fork until crumbly. Mix in ice water gradually until dough clumps together enough to form a ball. Roll into a disc with a rolling pin and place on a greased pie tin.

Filling:
Mix pumpkin, sugar, salt and spices in a pot over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then cook and stir frequently for 5 to 7 minutes. Dump the cooked pumpkin into a large mixing bowl, and whisk in the cream until smooth. Whisk in eggs one at a time till fully mixed. Pour filling into prepared pie crust.

Bake at 400 for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350. Bake for another 45 minutes or until you can stick a toothpick in the middle and it doesn't pull any pie out (wet is ok).

Depending on the size of your pie tin and crust, there may be extra filling. You can bake it in ramekins to make pumpkin filling cups, or better yet, double the recipe and make 3 pies!
