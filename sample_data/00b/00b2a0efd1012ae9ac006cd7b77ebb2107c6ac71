Chapter 29
Choice

Part 3
Opinion

Hero Club Room

Utano: Let me share my opinion since my fate was brought up earlier.
Utano: I choose to return.
Mito: Yeah. I knew you'd say that.
Utano: ...I would like to stay here longer, of course.
Utano: But we need to end this before it negatively affects Shinju-sama or the rebelling god gets a chance to make a comeback.
Utano: And the folks in Suwa are waiting for us. I'll change the fate of the real world!
Sekka: ...You're strong. A true hero. A good girl through and through, Utano.
Utano: That's not true. I'll say something selfish now.
Sekka: Eh?
Utano: Mii-chan.
Mito: Yeah? What is it, Utanon?
Utano: Things will get dangerous back in Suwa. Now that I know that, I want to be with you even more, Mii-chan.
Mito: !
Utano: I want you to come with me. That'll help me fight with my full power and some more.
Utano: I know it's dangerous. But I want to be with you.
Mito: ...
Mito: Maybe I'm being overdramatic, but when there was still peace, sometimes I thought...
Mito: Why was I born? I didn't have confidence in myself.
Mito: But now I know. I'm sure I was born to meet you, Utanon.
Mito: I like your choice much more than being left behind. I'm so happy you told me, Utanon!
Utano: ...Mii-chan.
Mito: I'll follow you anywhere, Utanon!
Utano: It's dangerous. But still, I'm glad. Did you see? I'm selfish.
Sekka: No. I'm coming to like you more and more. Both you and Mito.
Sekka: And that's precisely why I don't want to return! Anyone else who wants to share their opinion?
