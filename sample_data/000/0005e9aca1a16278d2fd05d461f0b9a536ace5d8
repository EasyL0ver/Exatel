2
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:17,309
A FILM BY
HEIKKI KUJANPÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž.

3
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,360
The Finnish Cicil War has ended
in the victory of the Whites

4
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,821
assisted by the Imperial German Army.

5
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:34,076
More than 80,000 Reds have been
locked up in prison camps.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,621
Thousands have already been executed,
or have starved to death.

7
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:43,044
Rebel leaders not captured yet
have gone into hiding,

8
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:46,505
fearing discovery.

9
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,632
CASH BOX

10
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:58,113
There's no one here.

11
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,050
Halt!

12
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,887
Halt!

13
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:07,516
LAUGH OR DIE

14
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,984
Any leaders?
Go!

15
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,951
Go home.

16
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,717
Go home, women.

17
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,646
Any leaders?

18
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,097
Go!

19
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,995
Fall in!
This way!

20
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,813
Get him on his feet! Move!

21
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,263
Form three lines!

22
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,399
Attention!

23
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:09,239
A straight line!
Don't lean against the wall! Rautio!

24
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,885
Repeat after me.
One, two, three. You there.

25
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,471
One.
Thank you.

26
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,645
You there. Let's hear it.

27
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,650
One, two. Death to the Russkies!

28
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,612
Your name?

29
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,283
Your name?

30
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:59,164
What's so funny? Your name!

31
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,918
Toby Belch.

32
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,671
Toby... Belch.

33
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,053
Belch.

34
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:10,485
How many are we?
Over a thousand in early summer.

35
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:14,114
Half of the Parliament's
Socialists were there.

36
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,241
Only a few left now.

37
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,881
Aulis!

38
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:17,552
Scourge of the ruling class
Sent to Hades, sent to jail

39
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:23,266
Summarily hanged, shot

40
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,186
Hero of the Revolution

41
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,939
Parikka?

42
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:34,986
Freedom carries a heavy price

43
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,453
There's still justice in the world.

44
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,876
Where are the rest? Johansson?

45
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,549
Where did you go?
You were to get help.

46
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,469
Headquarters was deserted.
You left us.

47
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,431
I couldn't get back through
that artillery fire.

48
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:07,394
You were seen at the Station.
On the leaders' escape train.

49
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,480
Who made us join the Guard?
Women, too.

50
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:14,276
Where's Tyyne now?
Pregnant, in some camp!

51
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,070
You're pretty well fed.
Got anything to eat?

52
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,656
No.
Liar!

53
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,244
Russki tack bread!

54
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,916
We're here because of you!

55
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,641
Do you still have nightmares?

56
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,436
No, Captain.

57
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,523
It's the sea air. It hardens you.

58
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,569
Siikander is the best tailor
in Helsinki.

59
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:01,114
He made Bobrikov the suit
he was shot in.

60
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,493
I have a job for you.

61
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,205
We have far too many prisoners.

62
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,417
You have three weeks
to get rid of these. Three weeks?

63
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:16,296
Head of the Prison Service
Major Juvelius will inspect the camp.

64
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,050
We must get these off the roster.

65
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,469
And I need a new uniform.

66
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,685
You will now carry out
the executions.

67
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,980
Can you handle it now?

68
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:37,025
Yes, Captain.

69
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:41,112
Just close your eyes when you
give the order. It'll be all right.

70
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:19,192
What were you looking at? The city?

71
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:23,196
German naval manoeuvres.

72
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,124
In three weeks' time I'll take you
to Hotel KÃƒÂ¤mp for an eggnog.

73
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,501
Or to a concert. I promise.

74
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,672
I enjoy myself here quite well.

75
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:47,762
Helen! Would you sing
for Major Juvelius' entourage?

76
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,434
The piano is out of tune.

77
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,655
Get inside!
No loitering outside after dark.

78
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,830
SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS

79
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,502
TWELFTH NIGHT

80
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,757
DRAMATIS PERSONAE
TOBY BELCH

81
00:16:55,682 --> 00:17:01,896
0 knight!
Thou lack (st a cup of canary!

82
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,704
Toby Belch.

83
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:23,043
I saw you in that role.
Couldn't think of a better name?

84
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:30,216
Alfred Nyborg.
Nyborg?

85
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,219
Gunnar's son?
One and the same.

86
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:38,016
I'll be damned. You were in breeches
when I saw you last.

87
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,603
What happened to your face?

88
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,866
What are you doing here?
Why didn't you say who you are?

89
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,203
You've got MPs here, too.

90
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,873
Did you join the rebellion? Why?

91
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,919
You'd only got the Russkies
back in power again.

92
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,049
From Russkies to Fritzes.

93
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:14,803
We'll soon have a German king,
won't we?

94
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:18,807
The Parliament
will decide on it soon.

95
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,852
I'm happy it's all over now.

96
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:27,941
Perhaps I'll see you on stage again.
Tell me.

97
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,862
All leaders will be shot, right?

98
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,992
A leader?

99
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,091
So, between us leaders.

100
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,483
To the end of the line!
Thanks. I ate already.

101
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,864
What's with Hannula? He's been
like that since they shot Elmeri.

102
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,449
You'll find another one yet.

103
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:23,621
Theatre people! Fall in!

104
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:26,666
Fall in!

105
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:33,173
Where are the rest? What do you
think? In wooden overcoats.

106
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,508
Shut up!

107
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,889
You laugh at me? Damn you!

108
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,767
Get up!

109
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,646
Right turn! Right!

110
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:54,360
Didn't you learn anything
in the Red Guard? Forward march!

111
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:59,824
Where're we going? Must be
the amnesty. It was in the papers.

112
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:04,621
Workers' Theatre people.
Leave your cups here.

113
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,475
Kasimir Elo, actor.

114
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:30,563
Born 3 February 1874
in the Parish of Helsinki.

115
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:41,491
Where were you in the evening
of April 12, this year?

116
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:45,036
At the theatre.
Taking care of the wounded.

117
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:50,750
Any witnesses?

118
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:55,713
Why?
According to Lieutenant Winge

119
00:20:55,797 --> 00:21:00,593
his unit was shot at from
the Workers' Theatre. We never shot.

120
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:04,973
That's what it says in here.
We haven't shot anyone.

121
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:08,351
Why did you have guns
when arrested?

122
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:12,563
We were ordered to.
Who gave the order?

123
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:24,784
If the one responsible is not
discovered, the duty of this court...

124
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:29,205
We never shot anyone.
Parikka! Tell them!

125
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,874
We were out of ammunition!

126
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,387
Who's he?
He's Parikka!

127
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:58,109
Toivo Parikka, the actor? Did he give
you orders? Yes! He put us up to it.

128
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,531
A leader and an agitator.

129
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,492
You know that it means
a death sentence?

130
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,911
Shall I tell him?
No.

131
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:12,206
Do you admit that your unit
fired upon the Germans?

132
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,296
Them?

133
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,677
They can't even to load a gun.

134
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:30,433
I killed them. No use to sentence
these shitpants for it.

135
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,563
How did you singlehanded

136
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,777
shoot twelve German
Special Forces soldiers?

137
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:44,906
I had twelve bullets left.

138
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:56,584
Tell us. How did you manage that?

139
