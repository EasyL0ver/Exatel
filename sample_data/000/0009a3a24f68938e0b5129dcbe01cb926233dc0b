    opened tangled and just said
    i was crying at that
    but i was mad that although sam kept saying you make her out to be the bad guy it was the total opposite, you were apologizing and apologizing and it took forever to get through to her and i thought "it's not just xander making her think all of these awful things about herself" and it's happened before, these things, and least three times since we began to talk again and i know it has happened even before then and hwne you cmae back on skype and said sam wanted to talk i got hurt because i felt like you were ditching me because she wantwd to talk, i get she is your gf and you were emending things, because whenever she gets mad and you put in all of this effort to make her happuy again, and you shouldnave to do that, but i had a surprise for you becasue i wanted yo uto cheer up and you just left so i got upset and i knew if i tried to keep you and surprise yo u it would have dned up bad and i didnt want anything to get bad but i was just upset that she treated you like that and it was like sending a dog out to the doghouse
