Easy way to make money this league:
>Don't do maps; just run Blood Aqueducts
>Replace members in the Syndicate until you get some combination of Cameria, Rin, Tora, Haku, It That Fled, Gravicius

Focus on Interventions and Research and level them up in the following priority
>Research: Cameria, It That Fled, Haku
>Intervention: Rin, Cameria, Gravicius, Haku

Now comes the tricky part:
>Run a single map to lock the Betrayal as a high-tier reward
>Start running Blood Aqueducts. Start leveling your guys. Should be 30s-60s per encounter
>As soon as you have 1 at level 3 (unless all the others are level 2 because some rewards will upgrade everyone in a division)
>Phase run or whatever through the mobs in the raid; just ignore everything until you get to the boss room.
>kill the division's boss; they're useless. never complete the Mastermind mission.
>Open chests and profit off expensive scarabs

For some reason, even though you ran 99% of the encounters in Blood Aqueducts, it takes the highest level encounter you did and bases the rewards on that. With the above guys in divisions, each raid is worth about 0.5-2 exalts. Given how fast you're farming Blood Aqueduct, you should be able to do one or two an hour.
