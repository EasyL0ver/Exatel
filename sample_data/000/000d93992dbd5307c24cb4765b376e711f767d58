/*
      PROJECT: C Premier Plus exercise 8-2
      PURPOSE: "Write a program that reads input as a stream of characters 
                until encountering EOF. have the program print each input 
                character and its ASCII decimal value. Note that characters 
                preceding the space character in the ASCII sequence are 
                nonprinting characters. Treat them specially. If the 
                nonprinting character is a newline or a tab print \n or \t, 
                respectively. Otherwise, use control-characters notation. 
                For instance ASCII 1 is Ctrl+A, which can be displayed as ^A. 
                Note that the ASCII value for A is the value for Ctrl+A 
                plus 64. A similar relation holds for the other non printing 
                characters. print 10 pairs per line, except start a fresh line 
                each time a newline character is encountered.
        DATES: 27 feb '19, afternoon - 
  DESCRIPTION: open input and inside a loop with several ifs count characters 
               each 10 turns print them
