Topic: An alien has descended on your planet demanding to know if he can learn the teleporting ways of your people. Describe in depth the super wild process of teaching someone how to teleport

	Sarasha turned away from the extra-terrestrial in declination to their demands. It was clear she did not want to teach it directly. As she began to step away the being lunged at her in retaliation. It wasn't until after she disappeared completely they stopped to look around. No where to be found, Sarasha's disembodied voice reached out to the descended alien.

"It is no simple task to transmit yourself. First you must connect with other life. Take this planet for example. It itself lives!" she exclaimed from beyond.

	To her own understanding, the technique known as the instant transmission is based off of moving energy across a space. Being familiar with a foreign energy that is not of yourself is key. Assimilating part of your own energy and moving the rest of thyself to it is the most basic principle of the ability.

"I am currently on the other side of the planet. By flowing energy into it I can move instantly anywhere on this world!" she exclaimed once again.

	The extra-terrestrial franticly senses out her life's signature and or presence but is unable to pinpoint it. They froze. A blade was struck through their back.

"You are in no need of such skill. You want it for the same reason I enacted. For this reason I will force you to pass on. Goodbye." She declared before the sword rushed with energy and her free hand grew in a concentrated ki which she then fire point blank in a massive beam.

After ensuring no signs of life, Sarasha buried the remains in offering to her home-world of Jungle,but it was only a few weeks later another sign of alien life descends upon her home.... Would history repeat itself?
