GA-EX58-DS4 ALC888-ish
0.2.0 - used to work with the same two channels on all the channels
      - stopped working after reinstall + 10.5.7
0.2.1, 0.2.2, 0.2.2 w/prefpane - the "working" low volume output is "Uknown", works after setting all possible outputs (mix included) to maximum volume
0.2.0 - need to retest since it used to work and it should do so again

P5N7A-VM, ALC1200 ? (some modded ALC888 or ALC889)
0.2.1 - google code trunk - lots of crackles and pops (occur more often at 192KHz and 96KHz than at    44.1KHz)
      - I get one output for "line out" which has a name which is something like: "line out / line out / line out / line out" <- maybe it's supposed to output the same stereo channel on 4 channels?
0.2   - same thing as with 0.2.1 from google code ( except for the "Line Out / Line Out.." name)
0.2.2 - need to retest to see what was going on exactly
