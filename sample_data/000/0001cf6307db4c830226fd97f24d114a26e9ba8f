\subsection{Part b: Pseudo Code for  Simulation of Scattering}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Generate an array of random heights ranging from [0, 1] and input them into the equation derived in Part a.
\item Take the input array and plot it as a histogram 
\item Take the output array and plot it as a histogram 
\item Given a sufficiently large input array that it emulates true randomness, calculate the probability that the scattering angle \theta  lies in the range  175 ^{\circ} < \theta < 185 ^{\circ}   versus   20 ^{\circ} < \theta <  30 ^{\circ}  
\begin{itemize}
\item  This calculation is done by comparing the ratios of particles within each range to the the total number of particles and to each range. 
\end{itemize}
