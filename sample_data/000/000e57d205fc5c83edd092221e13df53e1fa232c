look i was going to wait to ask you at least over the phone, but
it doesnt seem like thats happening anytime soon so here it is.

I understand i rushed into things i just want to put that out there
now you said you werent ready to date anyone because youre still 
healing, i understand that completely as im no stranger to having 
my feelings crushed. And i said id wait for you to heal, because
youre a sweet smart and just overall stunning girl, something im still
willing to wait for. But, you've gone from totally interested in
me to not really at all, and i cant understand why.

then i get a notification that you added a song to your tinder and
some pictures... i just dont understand kat, i know we aren't
even a thing, but you said it wasnt time for you to be in that world.

so that just makes me think youre looking for someone better, which
hurts but even if that was the case id understand. I mean youre 
gorgeous and have a future, i never really stood a chance. 

I can take the truth, please dont spare my feelings.
