Key: Raffness
Name: Sambal
Skill: Vaizard Mastery 3
Reasoning:   Sambal continues to grow more and more dedicated to being the Shield of Garuda and perhaps one day the Shield of Aurholm itself.   The young Makyan consistently seeks to prove his worth as a warrior and member of the Garuda.   Gifted with the power of Yanal, he was involved in the task of trying to free the Arcane Forest from the clutches of the newly revealed corrupting influence of the void.

He came face to face with a fearsome creature that seemingly could not be beat, till he used Yanal's power.   Sambal realizes that said power is extremely useful, but at the same time, without it, he likely wouldn't have stood a chance.   Sure, he would have been difficult to take down, but his defeat would have been inevitable.   So he resolves to master said power.

So he resolves to grow stronger over the coming years to better serve in his self-assigned role.   To grow stronger to protect the Garuda.   To protect his friends...and his family.
