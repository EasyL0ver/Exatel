To all the grownup kids who still believe in magic
Who can peer between the prison bars of fact
At the endless possibilities behind the remotest act
To those who live within their dreams
And know to marvel as the dullest stone gleams
If in questions without answer you can glimpse the craft of grand design
Within you lies the seed of the divine
