While running Hybrid EVA builds, the only stat you should trade Evasion for is AP, and only in proportionate amounts. I'll explain what I think is proportionate in a list below.

If you're running below 620 Evasion you should probably replace all of your Evasion items with AP and wear Urugon's instead. If you're not running Evasion very close (~5-10 points off at most) to 620, it's not worth running Evasion - most players will eat through your Evasion, making it almost worthless. You should just opt do more damage.

620+ Evasion if you have 234+ AP
650+ Evasion if you have ~220-233 AP
700+ Evasion if you have 209-219 AP
720+ Evasion if you have ~208 AP or below

Again, 620 Evasion is the bare minimum and only viable if you can meet the 234 AP bracket.

This was formulated based on feel and following B&S' testing, an average skill accuracy modifier of 15%, average accuracy from gear (350) and accuracy from skill add-ons + food.
