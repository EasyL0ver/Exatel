“dear national producers, 안녕하세요! trainee, na ah reum-입니다!

wah, honestly i felt like this is a dream come true, it really is! after hard days of training, (and the hard times of debuting) now i feel like i have finally accomplished something more. 

thank you for the national producers who looked out for me and supported me during this show, i am really really grateful and i didn't regret a single thing coming here

thank you for the people who i rely on most, the people who i love most, my dearest family who supported me, supported my dream, when i was little, thank you for being patient and showing me the right way. without you all, i don't even know if i'll be standing here right now or if i would be able to perform on stage, thank you mom and dad for supporting me and loving me, i will try my best and work hard to repay all of your good deeds. i love you all very very very much! 

thank you for boyeon-unnie and jieun-unnie, we fought alot but that doesn't mean i don't love the both of you, thank you for being one of my inspirations. i love you both! 

thank you for the mentors who mentored me, thank you for being patient whenver i made mistakes and thank you for fixing them

thank you for my trainee friends, we have been through hard times and i'm glad we can solve it out and pushed all of the negativity away. i am glad that we all got the chance to meet each other and teaming up with one another, it's sad that not all 130 of us are here standing on the same stage or sitting in the 12 glittery chairs but i know all of our memories have been kept inside a small chest in my heart

now i have realized that being a trainee needs sweat, determination and tears to get the job done and i am glad that i did, once again thank you all very very much, i owe you all, i will try to improve myself in here with the other members, gamsahamnida!” [makes a heart with her hands]
