The 27th of January, 11:30 AM (GMT+1), I will hold a tournament, with a twist. Since I watch a lot of AOE2, I got inspired by their "Hidden Cup", shoutout to T90.
The players will play on alts under different names (for example "Leo, Harry") and won't know who's who. Neither will you, that's the point. A little game will be made for the viewers as well, and if you can guess all eight players, then you win something or whatever, haven't gotten there yet.
It will be an EU vs AU vs SA (  :flag_br:  ) kind of thing, played on an NA server, cause i wanted all pings to be equal. Since I don't wanna make it obvious based on ping who is playing for either the players or you. If this happens again I won't diss the NA. Qualifiers/Semi-Finals are going to be BO3, final is BO5. The map pool consists of 9 maps, which are:
- kz_reach_v2
- kz_module
- kz_shark
- kz_wetbricks
- kz_gfy_c0mb0king
- kz_matilda_np
- kz_erinome
- kz_avoria
- kz_exoteric

The players are:
Gwooky
Giimpy
Orbit
Froggy
Shard
Vimmi
Ephney
Fdz

The point of this tournament is basically having top players against each other, but they don't know who they're up against, and also making it a game for you, the viewer. They all have "their kind of map" in the pool, so strategy on map picks might come into play. I could've worded this better, but I didn't.
Date and time might change, but probably not.
There will ofcourse be a prize pool.
Thanks to @Steak for helping me!

I will be having a stream in about an hour, maybe sooner. There I'll answer all your questions.
