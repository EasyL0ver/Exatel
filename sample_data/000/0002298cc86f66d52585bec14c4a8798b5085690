Grinned toothily, showing off the bit of her father in her with those dagger-like teeth. "You're free to do whatever you want with your dayjob, long as it doesn't draw any attention to me." Shrugging with her arms out slightly, about to speak again when the deeper voice called into the room, drawing her gaze to the man she now recognized as her anonymous benefactor. Even with the change of face, it was hard to not compare the presence, his large form and authority. It made her smirk fade surprisingly quickly. She wouldn't speak after he appeared, shifting off the bar and standing upright watching him. A medic, a spy, an assassin, and an A+-class combat quirk was certainly the makings of something dangerous.

juburu would not be the only one who shifted immediately upon the newest addition, despite his rather pleasant features-- she knew exactly who that was. her features drained completely, throat drying and fear gripping harshly around her heart. what is it like to stare evil in the face? waiting a few spare moments, she glanced to juburu before speaking. "I believe we have sir, thank you for approaching us." but why a bunch of punk kids and lost souls? her gaze sharpened, exhaling slowly to calm her racing heart. it would probably be one of the very few times anyone would see her paralyzed.

looking over to Kana, he saw that she was frozen like a deer in the headlights at the sudden appearance of the new guest. He didn't understand why she was so afraid of the man, sure he had no real face and only a mouth and ears. But he didn't see why she'd be afraid of him, he glanced at the man before shrugging. Though the snakes that were coiled around his stomach underneath his shirt would poke their heads out of the neck of his shirt hissing. He didn't understand what was going on, but whispered to the snakes to hush. The snakes fell silent and went back under his shirt, he didn't want to upset anyone with venomous snakes hissing at them.

Natsu 42 seconds ago
blinked looking over at the young male, even while the presence of a bigger entity was there. He had no fear of the man that just showed up, he was a bit more worried about the child with two of japan's deadliest snakes wrapped around him. He pointed to the child with the snakes, before asking everyone around him, "Why does that kid have venomous snakes with him?" Seeing the snakes listen to the kid, he gave a surprised expression. "I get it now, must be his quirk... A rather unusual quirk." Turning his attention back to the business at hand, he looked to the figure. "So, are you the one that had me summoned here, sir?" He also knew full well who was before him, it was One For All, or at least some form of projection.

He smirked at all of his 'guests' and adjusted his hologrpahic suit. "I am indeed the one who orgwnized this meeting. You see.. Me and your new employyer, Miss Juburu." He gestured to the female. "Have been coordinating together. - She wants a loyal group of hard workers, and I have been providing her with resources." -- The male then turned to the door. "Young orphan. Please join us now."

The whole event was a mystery to him. He had.. just been invited to his sister' job that day he presumed; but oh boy was he far far mistaken. At first it seemed like a normal meeting, but then - things changed when he hesrs a voice so disturbing it made him freeze instantly. "Yessir.." he would reply through the door. Before entering the room.

Juburu 48 seconds ago
Had certainly not expected him, having only realized who he was after his fight with All Might, when he was imprisoned. She'd been expecting the new, and much more manageable leader of the League of Villains. Still, she crossed her arms under her chest and glanced to Kana, then her new friend, then Natsu. Though his words put her more at ease, that this was a business interaction. "Resources are something I have in abundance, and now these new acquaintances....When is your subordinate with the League going to meet with me?" She'd speak while he called for the last, glancing to him in turn. She had money, a business to launder it, a front, connections with the Chinese Triad and much more shallow ones with the Yakuza, the League was the last piece of the puzzle.

Kana 3 minutes ago
seems that all she needed to do was start the conversation for it to get rolling again, it was only when he called Hayato out that she turned her attention to him fully. her frown deepened, tongue bitten to keep from venomously spitting out words better kept to herself-- he's not an orphan anymore. tense muscled slowly shifted, bringing her to step back enough for the boys to be presented to the lot of them. this was preferred, she was just an onlooker. the only issue was that hayato was involved now. jaw tightening, the red of her eyes shining a bit more intensely. now just to keep quiet and listen.

Hibiki Hebi 1 minute ago
shaking in a bit of fear from the fear of a bunch of people older than him, and maybe one person his age. He sighed as he walked forward into introducing himself. He still had the nasty habit of scratching his arms in nervousness or anxiety, but not the voices in his head. He remembered how he had heard the silver haired man introduce himself and tried presenting himself in the same manner. "Hello... My name is Hibiki Hebi... My quirk is controlling snakes and borrowing their traits... Currently fifteen years old, and trying to repay Miss Kana for shooting her twice out of my own arrogance, then her helping me dispose of my father's body..." Sighed after speaking all the words, not sure if he did good or bad, or if he said too much.
---------------------------------------
Natsu just now
wondered why there was now two kids here, sighed softly as he looked around the room. He did speak again, "So, what all are we going to be doing here today..? We've already seen snake boy show off his quirk. Do I have to the same as the runt? Because if so, I'll require two people to voluntarily step up for a demonstration..." What did he get himself into, regardless he kept his composure unlike the snake-bearing child.

The evil kingpin twisted a antagonistic grin. "Patience young one. Tomura will show himself soon.." however. He turned to Natsu. "No need for volunteers. Choose whoever you want. Mess with the whole lot of them if you want. I need them to understand your abilities very well."

Juburu 2 minutes ago
Tomura... Learned something from this at least, the name of her contact in the League. Relaxed more and shifted to lean back against the counter of her new establishment again, tapping her cheek with a finger and thinking a bit. Two children, a makeshift adult celebrity, and herself and Kana who could be considered about as adult as Tomura considering his mentality. "Don't choose Hibiki, last thing we need is his quirk losing control and those snakes biting him, and whoever's riding in him." He'd mentioned whoever got into the new body could use the body's quirk, but that didn't mean they'd have the ability to use it correctly right away, better safe than sorry. Though right now she was the only person who knew every quirk in the room anyways. "Choose whoever else you want."

Kana 4 seconds ago
a side glance was given to juburu, knowing what the woman was up to-- natsu wouldn't use her as a puppet just because she remained a leader. which left her and hayato. frowning very deeply, she turned her attention onto the boy. "... Don't touch anyone when you're using my body, I see you do something stupid and I'll ensure your punishment will be severe." now just to watch, and see what would happen.

Hayato Izuhoru 1 minute ago
It wouldn't be much of a problem really. Cause the moment Hayato heard the word 'league'. He got a pretty good idea of what the heck was going down. "I'm um- Sorry I uh- Apparently have to be somewhere so.." the teen made a break for the door. Whatever the hell his sister was spewing on about, he didn't even wanna know!
------------------------------------------
Hibiki Hebi 36 seconds ago
shuffled a bit hearing the mention of his name before nodding and moving back, he was still a bit uneasy around crowds. He was also glad to hear, that he wouldn't have to be a test dummy for someone's quirk demonstration. This left him to give out an honest sigh of relief.

Natsu 5 minutes ago
stepping front of Hayato, he grabbed the kid by the collar of his shirt and drag him over to Kana. He wasn't against roughing a kid up to get his job done, and that was made apparently shown just now. "Oh no, you don't kiddo. Come here, you and that lady over there shall be my demonstrations." Drug Hayato along with him as he made his way over to Kana. Let go of the boy's shirt collar as he'd be forced next to the woman. "Now you both may feel a bit of discomfort at first, but trust me. It will be interesting for you both to be in opposite sex's body." He says this as though he has already tried it, and with that statement escaping his lips. He would place his right hand onto Hayato's head, while his left hand touch Kana's chest. Figured, most girls would faint if a male model touched their chest and wanted to make her feel a bit better about the situation. The both of them would feel a slight shocking situation and discomfort as he had warn them
