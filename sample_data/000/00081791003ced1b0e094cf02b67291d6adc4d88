Peter blinked once, then twice, then three times before sighing, “Look Ghosty, all I want is for you to either get a long with me or to leave. Stop trying to make me go mad or something because it is NOT working.” He was sitting across from a dead guy. Keyword, dead. Sitting across from him was a redhead whose curly hair was unrulely. He had a cute baby face a long with freckles to adorn, his eyes although glazed shown a bright brown that had a red tint to it. His skintone was a healthy kind of light color. He  looked more alive than Peter did actually. The ghost sighed and looked Peter in the eyes, “Look here, Bionda, you needa stop trying because it’s not happening. You either go crazy, die, and we’ll be done. You’ll go to heaven and I’ll haunt someone who I’ll have better luck killing.” Peter shook his head, his hair was a bright blonde and he wore a beanie. He himself wasn’t looking healthy as he was deathly pale, looking fragile, and with bags under his eyes he looked like he was ready to murder. But actually it was just him trying to keep up in College. Funny huh? Peter facepalmed and went back to checking his grades, rubbing the bridge of his nose. He was never gonna make it to second semester with this redhead.
