Hey it is Monday, you know what that means.

Work life: Got my yearly review tomorrow, I am up for a promotion so we will see if I get it. I also have two feelers out for potential interviews one still in Huntsville the other in San Francisco. Waiting to hear back at this point.

Submitted Sonic 06, Mega Man ZX Advent, and Torna for SGDQ. I am now planning on going the whole week. The downside is that this GDQ will be my last for a while. I love the marathon and seeing my friends but I want to take a few other trips next year. I am thinking a Europe trip with Neoky. I have never left the US and it has been something I really want to do (Also want to meet Frozer IRL for once). I will always be going to RPGLB so there is that at least, just cutting back on GDQ trips from now on.

Stream/Speedrunning: Been working on a Vesperia NG+ file just to do a run for the leaderboard, I havent started working on NG yet just havent had the motivation lately. Going to do some Mega Man ZX Advent Derust soon. If Sonic 06 gets into SGDQ I will start derusting it as well. After I have learned Vesperia and have the time I like my plan is to learn Xeno X next.

D&D and RP stuff: My local group that Neoky dms has been going well, Neoky is getting a little burnt out DMing though so after we wrap up this arc I will be switching over for a while. We will be switching to a Stars without numbers campaign which I have really been looking forward to running. Finally get to use my universe with cybernetic cannibals in it! I want to try and get another online group going either for DMing or playing. Just need to start putting out feelers again.

Well that is it for now, time to survive a slow week at work
