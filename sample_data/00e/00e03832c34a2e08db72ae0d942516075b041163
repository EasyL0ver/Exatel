   prog1RockPaperScissors.cpp
 
   Program #1: Play the game of Paper / Rock / Scissors against the computer.
   Class: CS 141
   Author: *** Farooq Syed ***
	 
	 See the program description page on the course web site at bit.ly/cs141
	 Within Codio you can run the solution by doing the following steps:
   1. Select the Tools / Terminal menu option
	 2. Within the terminal window, type in:  ./solution

   Grading Rubric:
		 55 Execution points
						  Option 1: (Computer always chooses R) and:
					 2		 User input of X immediately exits program
					 3		 User input of x (lower case) immediately exits program
				  10		 Program handles both lower and upper case user input (e.g. 'r' and 'R'); also
					          move number increments each move
				  15		 Score updates correctly for all user inputs: r, p, s
						  Option 2: Computer's move is random and:
					 7		 Predetermined input sequence correctly leads to computer win
				   8		 Predetermined input sequence correctly leads to human win
		         Option 3: 
           2     Correctly displays and updates the graphical score
		       8     Correctly displays and updates the graphical score, with assessment results hidden

		 45 Programming Style (Given only if program runs substantially correctly)
					10 Meaningful identifier names
					10 Comments: Has header.  Comments on each block of code.
					15 Appropriate data and control structures.  Code duplication is avoided.
					10 Code Layout: Appropriate indentation and blank lines.
 
   Having sample program output is not required within this header of your program, though it is helpful.
