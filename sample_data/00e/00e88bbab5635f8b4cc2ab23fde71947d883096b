Personality: She could be described as â€˜the mean girlâ€™ by others - but she is simply being straight forward rather than hiding her thoughts. Sheâ€™s quite narcissistic and â€˜rudeâ€™, but she keeps herself to herself, not causing a scene -a snitch and backstabs for her own benefit: Usually stirs up a lot of drama and then likes to watch from afar. However, she obviously a bit more softer in the inside, and has actual intent rather than being an brainless zombie 

Do they have any siblings? Or a family? If so, what happened to them?: She grew up - living with her younger brother and her mother. (Their dad decided to leave them after the younger brothers birth) Her younger brother was always favourited by the mother! Currently - sheâ€™s living by herself, while her mother and her brother share an apartment together. 

 Are you on the run?  : Noo

How did you hear about us looking for new members? : Because she is normally outcasted because of her harsh views towards others, people from â€˜differentâ€™ cliches have been telling her about this group - as an attempt to become friends with her. Growing curious, lots of things happen...

Background: As she was growing up, she had experienced favouritism between her brother, and had always had to look after him. Sheâ€™s suffered quite a traumatic experience with friends, as sheâ€™s already expectant that they would judge her quickly rather than actually spend time to get to know her. Boos never had a boyfriend, so sheâ€™s a bit inexperienced ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ

 Friends/ Boyfriends/ Girlfriends? What happened to them? : Never had a significant other; she used to have a lot of friends, because of her looks rather than her personality, but they felt as if they didnâ€™t really understand her, so sheâ€™s had an â€˜off and onâ€™ relationship with friends. But, she is normally alone and she likes it that way 

 Are you okay with leaving home?  Yess

Will you be okay living in a dorm provided by the Mafia?  : Yess
