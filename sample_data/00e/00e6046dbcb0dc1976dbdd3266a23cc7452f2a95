[17:45]  [17:39] Flinn May i ask you a Hypothetical question?
[17:39] Macchiato shoot
[17:39] Flinn Ok so you let someone who is not of age into a RP/ERP chat for 18 and older.  You let him/her in there under certain circumstances; would you let them RP?
[17:42] Macchiato Assuming I can claim I failed my background check... I do those checks when someone joins the channel, so if I suddenly say 'hey, this person shouldn't be here' and they've been here for a while, that won't seem right
[17:45] Flinn So if this under aged person rp's for a while without anyone saying any thing than when he/she gets caught you wont do anything?
[17:45] Macchiato I'm HORRIBLE with names
[17:46] Flinn What do you mean?
[17:46] Macchiato I don't know, man
[17:47] Flinn ok
[17:57] Flinn Im sorry about all the Hypothetical questions but how would someone introduce a character into a RP like plotbook?
[17:58] Macchiato Well, now's not the time for it.
[17:58] Macchiato Huge actiony week.
[17:59] Macchiato Lockdown.
[17:59] Macchiato But if they were, it would be by coming upon the mansion and finding ponies.
[18:00] Flinn How long would the mansion be under Lockdown?
[18:00] Macchiato if things go as I predict... til wednesday or so
[18:01] Flinn Ok
[18:01] Flinn This is such a weird conversation....Hypothetically and such.
[18:01] Macchiato mhm
[18:02] Flinn -----Hypothetical-ness off------
[18:02] Flinn Can you RP with blind Eye?
[18:02] Macchiato Yessir.
