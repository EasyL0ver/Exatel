I let Vomica know last night about that, so hopefully he'll fix that when he gets on today.
I've also thought your situation over quite a bit and discussed it, and I definitely understand your situation
But given that you represent the guild and especially given that your LoveTM people engage in generally unsavory behavior (reported by not just myself), I'm going to have to ask that you have Az join the guild, or not interact with guildies on an alt that is not in Tsundere.
I hope you don't think I'm singling you out in any way! I would ask this of Vom if she had active alts, and upon reflection this is the main reason that I did not have my own wiz alt join any guilds. I didn't want to take up space in Tsundere at the time, but I also did not want people to think it was weird that a guild leader was also part of a different guild.
I think we have a strong sense of guild loyalty going on, and having such a prominent guild leader be actively part of another guild is jarring for many members.
I understand that initially you did not want to take up space in Tsundere, but as you know these concerns are now behind us.
Also, I understand that you feel somewhat indebted to your mentor in your LoveTM guild for helping you with gears and such, but I think "I am a Jr. of an active guild and they want all alts in the guild" is more than sufficient reason for any guild leader. I'd understand if one of our members had to leave because of that reason. And if you think they'll not be happy with that and retaliate in any way -- well, now you're staying in a guild due to effectively bribery and blackmail, so I can't say that's a healthy reason to stay either.
Anyhow, sorry that ended up being so long, but I wanted to make sure I was as clear as possible about what I was thinking and why I think this is the best course of action.
As a final note of clarification, I would ask your active alts to join Tsundere regardless of the guild they were in, i.e. even if it was not LoveTM and no one in the guild had a bone with them. Given we have space, it's strange for guild leaders to have active alts in other guilds in general. This is just especially true in this case due to the nature of the other guild in question.

Hmm. I don't think it's strange for an MMO to have multiple guilds. So I don't mind simply... not helping the guild with my alt. Also, if it would make you more comfortable, I can step down as a Jr.
I clearly don't take this game seriously as some so I don't need the responsibility. I just liked recruiting/welcoming ppl.
Nero TwoToday at 9:04 AM
Haha I see.
I think it's quite strange, so I'll just ask that you don't do guild activities on alts not in Tsundere.
thefacelessevilToday at 9:05 AM
Nooo problem.
Nero TwoToday at 9:05 AM
Btw, you partied with Deed on your LoveTM char right
thefacelessevilToday at 9:06 AM
I don't remember off the top of my head. Probably? It wasn't recent tho.
Nero TwoToday at 9:06 AM
Yeah I figured.
It's just a little funny to me how you portrayed being in LoveTM as not that important to you, constantly saying you were gonna leave anyway
And now you're willing to step down as Jr just to stay in that guild
thefacelessevilToday at 9:07 AM
Well here's the thing...
I have more than just Az in different guilds. It's like if I was friends with you and someone else and you said "no you can only be friends with me." I don't really find that a happy feeling. To me it's just a game, I should be allowed to play the way I want so long as it's not harming anyone and if you think me helping out guild out with ET when a tank isn't around is harmful just because he's in a diff guild then I won't do it. I don't mind simply... not doing things to make you comfortable.
Nero TwoToday at 9:12 AM
LOL
thefacelessevilToday at 9:12 AM
Er...
Nero TwoToday at 9:12 AM
I didn't realize that this was such a high school friend group type issue
But if you see it that way, then do as you wish
thefacelessevilToday at 9:12 AM
I mean, it feels that way.
Nero TwoToday at 9:13 AM
Hence the LOL
I personally don't care what you do with your alts or who you choose to play with or whatever
as long as it doesn't lead to situations of conflict of interest
thefacelessevilToday at 9:14 AM
Cmon man, I don't laugh at your point of view. I try to be compassionate and understanding, but I also want you to please respect my stance.
Yeah I'll keep it separate.
Nero TwoToday at 9:14 AM
I've respected your stance every single time until now Saph.
I don't think you have any right to make that sort of statement.
thefacelessevilToday at 9:14 AM
Sigh.
Nero TwoToday at 9:14 AM
"Sigh."?
You know it's true.
thefacelessevilToday at 9:16 AM
Look man, I'm old. I don't need to argue with people about guilds on korean mmorpgs. I really enjoy this guild for the people and I appreciate you being honest with me but I don't appreciate you being flippant at me when I'm agreeing to some of your offers. I said I'd keep it separate.
Nero TwoToday at 9:17 AM
Flippant? Listen, you've literally sulked and been passive aggressive with me EVERY TIME I've asked something of you that you didn't like.
And now you treat this like some sort of high school clique nonsense.
And you're telling me "I'm old"?
thefacelessevilToday at 9:17 AM
I think you might be reading stuff in my tone that isn't there.
Nero TwoToday at 9:17 AM
Nope.
Listen, let me put it to you straight. I didn't want to hurt your feelings or whatever, but I feel that I've been extremely professional with you so far until you started doing some frenemy bullshit.,
thefacelessevilToday at 9:18 AM
Do I make you uncomfortable in general? Would you prefer if I just went?
Nero TwoToday at 9:19 AM
You're trying to eat the cake and have it too, and been vacillating back and forth about LoveTM.
And now you're treating it as if you're being restricted in some way.
thefacelessevilToday at 9:19 AM
I've never even talked about Love except to say I haven't had a good relationship with them.
Nero TwoToday at 9:19 AM
?
"I don't like them, I've already tried to leave" except you're making every excuse possible not to leave the guild
If that's not vacillating, what is?
thefacelessevilToday at 9:20 AM
I only have one excuse.
Nero TwoToday at 9:20 AM
"Oh, I didn't realize my paladin could join Tsundere! That's amazing!"
Oh, but never mind you're restricting my choices. I'm out.
thefacelessevilToday at 9:20 AM
Well, I didn't. Please don't treat me like a moron just because I didn't know that.
Nero TwoToday at 9:20 AM
I'm not
I'm saying you just said two things that contradicts each other.
I'm saying you're not being clear with your stance. You're trying to say you're a good guild member, while also trying to stay within another guild that now has three other guildies complaining about.
thefacelessevilToday at 9:21 AM
Having the option to join with my paladin is amazing, I think it's a cool thing.  It's an option that I liked.
Anyway, you made a couple of offers and I picked a couple of them. 1 being I don't help the guild with alts and 2 being I can step down as a Jr and maybe you'll find someone who has more of a viewpoint aligned with yours. I don't want to make you uncomfortable. I also don't want you to think I'm some PA sulky person. I just wanna play the game.
Nero TwoToday at 9:26 AM
Saph, that's where you're wrong.
thefacelessevilToday at 9:26 AM
And if you dislike me as a person because you think I'm a jerk or whatever, I can go. I'll be sad and miss all of you but...
Nero TwoToday at 9:26 AM
You constantly paint yourself as someone who's chill and just wants to play the game, but that's clearly false.
Anyhow, as you said, you can simply not party with alts with guild members.
thefacelessevilToday at 9:27 AM
Well, I don't wanna argue about who I am... because I think I am this person.
Nero TwoToday at 9:27 AM
Again, trying to paint yourself as a saint by constantly saying "helping" doesn't help your case.
thefacelessevilToday at 9:27 AM
... that's all it was tho?
Nero TwoToday at 9:27 AM
Well it's false though?
thefacelessevilToday at 9:28 AM
They wanted a tank, I helped with a tank. I don't see how that's false? It's not like I had ulterior motives.
Nero TwoToday at 9:28 AM
Whatever you say.
thefacelessevilToday at 9:29 AM
You clearly have a picture of me that I just don't understand.
Nero TwoToday at 9:29 AM
Anyway, I think the required discussion is over.
thefacelessevilToday at 9:29 AM
Yes sir.
Nero TwoToday at 9:29 AM
Hmm, that's pretty understandable. Most people don't see themselves in the way they appear to others.
I hate inconsistency and people who flock in it, and you've recently started doing more of that.
I hope you understand why I feel that your "high school clique" stance is ridiculous. I spent a good chunk of my time thinking about this, and I understand you think it's "just some korean MMO", which is in itself not very helpful.
I felt that I gave you a reasoned and thoughtful argument on why I don't think you staying in LoveTM is a good idea.
All I got in return was "you're stopping me from making friends."
If you really think I'M the one being flippant here, then I have to say that you should review the conversation at hand.
thefacelessevilToday at 9:33 AM
Yeah, I'm sorry I don't think I take it seriously enough. Which butts up against your view. But I hope you understand my viewpoint was never "you're stopping me from making friends" because I never said that.
Nero TwoToday at 9:33 AM
Honestly. Just cool off and read the DM we just had, and tell me again that I'm being flippant at you.
" It's like if I was friends with you and someone else and you said "no you can only be friends with me."  "
??????????????????????
thefacelessevilToday at 9:34 AM
I thought it was clear that was an analogy.
Nero TwoToday at 9:34 AM
And your
