It's easy enough, I'll describe the manual method and it's fairly quick.

Rescale the rig (in figure mode if using biped) with the skinned model in place. The model will stretch as it's skinned to the bones.

For each skinned part of the model (most models are one part):
1. Copy the Skin modifier in the stack (right click, Copy)
2. Paste it on the stack (Right click, Paste)
3. Turn off the Copy (light bulb)
4. On the first skin modifier, collapse it (Collapse To, not Collapse All). You've now taken the stretched model and effectively baked that data back down to edit poly/mesh.
5. Turn on the copied skin modifier - the model will deform wrongly.
6. In the skin modifier, go to Advanced and find the Always Deform checkbox. turn it off, then back on.

Done.

If you need to edit the mesh, simply turn off the skin, edit the mesh, then repeat steps 5 and 6.
