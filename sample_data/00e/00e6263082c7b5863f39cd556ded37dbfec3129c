<ThaUnExpected> u gonna be online for abit? as we kinda need to talk over a few things
<GaMe_work> yeah
<GaMe_work> it might take me a minute to respond tho so dont get mad
<ThaUnExpected> k, and thats cool
<ThaUnExpected> anyways where to start...
<ThaUnExpected> if im not wrong i sent ya the pm about that i thought the drops and stuff was a bit unfair sorted out, as every1 would get the same amount of chance to get the same amount of stuff, no matter how much they contributed to the crew, aslong as they had been placed on the list and not taken off it but stayed there, what do u think about that? that for example me with 8 acc's get the same kind of rewards as for example deniz or trixz that only got 1 guy each? do u think its fair to have it like we do now or do u think like me in that we need to make some changes and reward people depending on how much they distrubute to the crew?
<ThaUnExpected> i feel like it would be a bit odd to continue with this way, as its a great way to deal with things if its for a short amount of time, but not if its gonna last... as in deniz got a dragon item, u got a dragon item, trixz got a dragon item and 2 maps, and when its my turn, "oh looks like tue only got 5 furies, sucks to be him... moving on" aswell as i honestly belive that im the one bringing the most into the crew as chibi isnt around so im taking care of his(our) accounts, aswell as i raid around the same amount as every1 else + bring in the stronger accounts and suddenly im just forgotten and its like "too bad" and thats about it
<ThaUnExpected> might not be me next time, might be some1 else, and it might take 1 or 2, even 3 or 4 rounds before some1 even get a drop while the others get a bunch each round
<ThaUnExpected> i dont see how thats fair just basic it on pure luck aswell as putting every1 on a equal standing aslong as they are on the list they deserve the same amount (with luck ofc)
<GaMe_work> How would you suggest we change it
<ThaUnExpected> i was thinking... to get ur point of view of it and then go from there
<GaMe_work> I mean, like you have said before lifes not fair.. so its going to be impossible to really find any way that is "fair" thats why i thought we agreed to leave it to chance
<GaMe_work> But if you have a better idea im up to hear it
<ThaUnExpected> well what im trying to say is that if some1 end up not getting anything for like 2 or 3 rounds in a row if not more, which is more than likely to happend at some point, aswell as some1 else continues to get good shit, i wouldnt really be suprised if that person who didnt get anything raged and left the crew for not feeling apriciated enough
<GaMe_work> But in reality it has nothing to do with the crew.. Its up to chance.  Thats like raging at the dealer of BJ cause you lost...
<ThaUnExpected> thats why im guessing most people would feel better joining a different crew if that were to happend as they are helping out alot and not getting shit
<GaMe_work> Well idk bro, i mean i dont know anyone that disagrees with the system now... If someone leaves just cause they got a shit drop thats not really the kind of people we need anyways right?
<ThaUnExpected> i guess, but lets not forget that pd have been talking about leaving the crew after just getting in he expects something right away, i wouldnt be suprised if he left at any point as last time he considered it was yesterday when he left with his multis and then invited them back again today... and lets not forget that u said u would leave the crew if ge joined, even tho u changed ur mind that dont show alot of loyalty either, and ofc lets not forget that trixz pretty much talked his way into stealing my drop while u were literally "begging" me (not really begging as it cant be called that unless u said "i beg u" which u didnt, but u did however say please at some point if im not wrong) to give the drop to trixz, and then on top of that i end up getting a shit drop and we move on like nothing have happend, aswell as ive never gotten anything from the crew before except the 2 holy blades that i spent 20k points on the raids so that we could get 1st place on the woz boss and get them in the first place, aswell as without the chegs we pretty much wouldnt have a chance in hell to even reach the top5's in the boss raids if u ask me... i could be wrong tho, but even if i am, im sure u can see im quite frustrated by this?
<GaMe_work> Ok, So what do you suggest?
<ThaUnExpected> like i said, i dont really have a suggestion, just was interested in ur thoughts about it for now, simply put, do u belive that me and u (who have the most accounts and also raid) deserve more or the same amount as every1 else in the crew that only raid and bring like 1 or 2 accounts into the crew? using arj isnt too hard if u ask me, it shouldnt be such a high reward for it as u can raid all day long and still do 0 dmg if u dont got any decent accounts to use
<GaMe_work> I see what your saying
<GaMe_work> Dont you think that will piss off the crew tho
<ThaUnExpected> well i dont see why we should "suffer" and get treated in the same way when we are helping out the crew more, if they really do care about the crew and not only themselves, they would agree...if they do, is however something completely different as i honestly dont belive we got a single loyal crew member that would stick with us until the end
<ThaUnExpected> also, if all that we needed was 1 acc each in the crew to make it fair,then every1 would have all their multies in different crews to earn some items here and some items there in all the different crews and it would be no point to even have a crew in the first place, aswell as i belive we are one of the few crews that award the most items to our crew members in the shortest amount of time as its not alot of us in here anyways
<ThaUnExpected> while we still do decent on the boss raids and usually get a decent spot
<ThaUnExpected> back in the day, i spent 4 years in the same crew, and all i got was 1 cobalt set, 3 symp sets, left the crew for 2 months to get a ele set as we were simply too weak to take it down ourselves, so it took me an entire 2 months to earn a ele set in a different crew even tho i was already mates with one of the leaders and i raided each day on both ele and noc for them the shit i raided was also awarded to other members, yet i still didnt feel like i didnt get what i deserved, i was more than happy with that i got the ele set, by the time i got back to the crew i started playing in, we managed to barely beat ele so i got 3 more ele set's for my acc and a noc set, and thats pretty much all i got after playing for many years, yet at no point were i not satisfied by what i got, but unlike back then, it seems like people are forgetting what they are actually getting, pirate maps and dragon items arent really a walk in the park just cuz we can beat it, and people should be happy and thankfull for that we are getting them shit, even if it would take longer than it do now
<ThaUnExpected> but then again thats just my point of view...
<GaMe_work> Ok, i get everything your saying.
<GaMe_work> But i dont really have any ideas for a new system.
<GaMe_work> If you could maybe throw some out we could start a brain storming session
<ThaUnExpected> only thing i can "throw out" is that u expected to get 2 dragon items for the "confusion" and stuff like that when u didnt get the first dragon item but got urs 3-4 days later, seeing how from my point of view trixz "stole" my drop, wouldnt it be for that i get some kind of compensation for it aswell?
<GaMe_work> Trixz didnt steal anything.. 
<GaMe_work> But what kind of compensation are you thinking
<GaMe_work> And to cover what you said before about me saying i would leave if ge came back is because CJ and I agreed that once you leave there is no coming back
<GaMe_work> this was before Chibi went afk
<GaMe_work> brb smoke
<ThaUnExpected> he "spoke his way into getting it" is more like what happend than stole i guess, if u were to get 2 drops then so should deniz, first the first dragon item for doing the most dmg on the boss who was still alive by the time the new raid rules changed, and then u would get a drop and then he should have gotten one after that aswell, and then ur turn again if indeed u were to get a other drop, meaning trixz should have gotten the 5th drop which was this one and u would have ended up with his/my drop, but then again i dont belive 2 drops is in place as it was not brought up properly before storm died and dropped 1 dragon item and 2 maps, it was first then that he brought it up, not to mention he is just a crew member and yet he decides stuff like that? aswell as u shouldnt get any say in if it makes sense or not if u didnt even know about that the previous dragon before that was ur drop, actually none of the crew leaders(me and u basically) knew about it, so why would it be like that?
<ThaUnExpected> cj did however agree on that ge could leave for a bit and come back tho?
<GaMe_work> Then he never came back
<GaMe_work> but thats a different issue.
<GaMe_work> and he still hasnt trusteed
<GaMe_work> so in my eyes hes only in the crew so i cant hit him
<GaMe_work> But how would you like to do the drops
<ThaUnExpected> no clue
<ThaUnExpected> was hoping u would come up with something smart
<GaMe_work> Hmmm
<GaMe_work> If you would like we can get rid of the raid rules, and ill take charge of the distribution of items.  Ill be fair well as "Fair" as i can be
<ThaUnExpected> i dont see the fairness of u alone deciding the distribution of the items tho
<GaMe_work> The only thing about it is im not going to argue with u about every drop.  and thats how it was before we had the raid rules implemented 
<GaMe_work> and as long as i give items out to the people that deserve it how is that not fair?
<ThaUnExpected> then, if making 1 of us figure out the handouts and not both of us, why would
