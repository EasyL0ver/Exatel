Now that Tony Stark has revealed to the world that he is Iron Man, the entire world is now eager to get their hands on his hot technology - whether it&#39;s the United States government, weapons contractors, or someone else. That someone else happens to be Ivan Vanko - the son of now deceased Anton Vanko, Howard Stark&#39;s former partner. Stark had Vanko banished to Russia for conspiring to commit treason against the US, and now Ivan wants revenge against Tony - and he&#39;s willing to get it at any cost. But after being humiliated in front of the Senate Armed Forces Committee, rival weapons contractor Justin Hammer sees Ivan as the key to upping his status against Stark Enterprises after an attack on the Monaco 500. But an ailing Tony has to figure out a way to save himself, get Vanko, and get Hammer before the government shows up and takes his beloved suits away. And can he figure out what a mysterious figure named Nick Fury wants with him?
With the world now aware of his dual life as the armored superhero Iron Man, billionaire inventor Tony Stark faces pressure from the government, the press, and the public to share his technology with the military. Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts, and James &quot;Rhodey&quot; Rhodes at his side, must forge new alliances - and confront powerful enemies.
The old saying too many cooks spoil the broth springs to mind. Here there are too many plot elements and redundant characters. Mickey Rourke looks impressive but, like everything else here, is wasted in a film which tries to cram too much in. Whiplash, Black Widow, Nick Fury, Justin Hammer, War Machine are all quickly introduced and then scantly used. The first fight at the race track between Whiplash and Stark is the highlight but could have been so much better. For instance, we see Pepper Potts driving to deliver Iron Man&#39;s armour to him in the opposite direction to the race cars. This could have been an exhilarating scene worth of The French Connection, but not much is made of it. It is not well explained what Whiplash has against Stark. Then comes Hammer, a dull corporate villain very similar to the dull corporate villain in the first film. Why can&#39;t Hollywood get beyond these off the peg evil capitalists? A fight with another Iron Man. Some secret agents. Then more Iron men. A lot of gimmicky effects. Nothing we haven&#39;t seen many times before.
Iron Man 2 WAS great, not the better than Dark Knight, but Great. It was just like its last predecessor &quot;IRON MAN I&quot; But IRON MAN II Was a little bit better. The only thing that certain people criticize is the each individual plot, each individual had their own Story elements, But in My opinion it was Better like that. You need a film with great Character development, not just ACTION ACTION ACTION. The Action needs to Blend in with the story, it&#39;s like a song same beat, but Just snaps &amp; wakes you up. ROBERT DOWNERY JR. IS the BEST Tony Stark In Marvel universal, The IRON MAN is so BAD-A**, And the race track OMG it&#39;s so SEXY. Don Cheadle: WAR MACHINE/RHODES Was used great in my opinion, I sort of Miss Terrance Howard, cause he carried that swag, but other wise WAR MACHINE Suit looks BAD-A** Etc, don&#39;t want spoil. MICKEY: WHIPLASH, I Thought was a smooth Criminal. In the Movie they used him as a smooth guy who wants vengeance on the STARK family, Mickey did a well done expression with him, but he was still a bad a** too. THE BLACK WIDOW chick, All I have to say is WOW. Samuel L. JACKSON: As NICK FURY, I Liked how they used him in a way and Black widow to assemble the AVENGERS ( The superhero teams, THOR, CAPTAIN America, HULK &amp; IRON MAN &amp; MORE) Justin HAMMER Was like an opposite side of TONY STARK, his acting was spot on to. IT Just had a great cast. including Pepperpotts. The thing I Wish was a little longer was the end battle between The 3. (Don&#39;t want spoil) Make No mistake, IRON MAN 2 Is Excellent 4 outta 4 stars for me. It&#39;s just like it&#39;s comics. If you read them more, then you&#39;ll understand what the movie is coming from, I CAN&#39;T WAIT FOR IRON MAN III &amp; THE AVENGERS. NICE JOB, IRON MAN 2 IS THE WAY TO GO, FOR FAMILY &amp; GEEKY FRIENDS.
Favreau supplies the go-go-go that makes the movie stratospherically entertaining, even without 3-D. But it's the promiscuously talented Downey who adds the grace notes that make Iron Man 2 something to remember.
Now that his identity as Iron Man has been made public, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (<a href="/name/nm0000375/">Robert Downey Jr.</a>) is being pressured by the government, the public, and the press to share his technology with the military. Meanwhile, Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (<a href="/name/nm0000620/">Mickey Rourke</a>), whose father was once partners with Tony&#39;s father, has recently partnered with rival weapons contractor Justin Hammer (<a href="/name/nm0005377/">Sam Rockwell</a>), planning to create Iron Man drones to demonstrate at the Stark Weapons Expo. On top of that, Tony discovers that his body is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in the arc reactor that keeps the shrapnel from piercing his heart. Expecting to die within the year, he appoints his former personal assistant Pepper Potts (<a href="/name/nm0000569/">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>) to the position of CEO of Stark Industries, replacing her with Natalie Rushman (<a href="/name/nm0424060/">Scarlett Johansson</a>), who isn&#39;t all that she seems. Iron Man 2 is the second movie in American director Jon Favreau&#39;s Iron Man series, preceded by <a href="/title/tt0371746/">Iron Man (2008)</a> (2008) and followed by <a href="/title/tt1300854/">Iron Man 3 (2013)</a> (2013). The Iron Man character is based on a comic book of the same name created by Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee and artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. Iron Man first appeared in issue #39 of Tales of Suspense (March 1963). The screenplay for Iron Man 2 was written by American screenwriter Justin Theroux. The sequel takes place six months after the first one. The first scene of the film directly follows the ending of the first one, then after that scene, the film&#39;s timeline jumps forward six months. Iron Man, of course, plus War Machine (<a href="/name/nm0000332/">Don Cheadle</a>), Nick Fury (<a href="/name/nm0000168/">Samuel L. Jackson</a>), and Black Widow appear. There are references to at least three other superheros: the Hulk is referenced in a news report of the aftermath of his university battle, Captain America&#39;s shield is featured, and Thor&#39;s hammer (Mjolnir) is seen after the end credits. Finally, 7 years after the release of the film, Marvel confirmed a long-held fan theory that the boy wearing the Iron Man helmet who is saved by Tony is a young Peter Parker (Spider-Man), although they did not reveal if this was an intentional Easter Egg or a retcon. There are two versions of Nick Fury. The white Nick Fury is the original and has appeared in Marvel&#39;s comic books since 1964. This version of Nick Fury was depicted by <a href="/name/nm0001327/">David Hasselhoff</a> in the 1998 TV movie, <a href="/title/tt0119781/">Nick Fury: Agent of Shield (1998)</a>. In 2001 Marvel released a new line of comic books called Ultimate Marvel. This was a reboot that updated and streamlined all of Marvel&#39;s classic characters. Some characters were radically changed. The Ultimate Marvel version of Nick Fury was made black and designed, with the actor&#39;s permission, to look like Samuel L. Jackson. Both classic Marvel and Ultimate Marvel comics are released side-by-side, which means both versions of Nick Fury are available in comic books today. The Ultimate version has proven popular enough that it has been used as the basis for Nick Fury in the recent Marvel movies. Natalie doesn&#39;t speak with a Russian accent because she doesn&#39;t want anyone to suspect her of being a Russian agent. In <a href="/title/tt0848228/">The Avengers (2012)</a> (2012), Natalie mentions that she is indeed Russian, but also implies that she wants to distance herself from that fact; another good reason for dropping the accent. It is called the Swinging Sticks. Howard Stark (Tony&#39;s father) built and designed Captain America&#39;s suit and also the shield. In Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), we see that Howard Stark had made quite a few prototypes for Cap&#39;s shield and Rogers picked one, (which was the simplest design in the shop) and was the one he was frozen with. It&#39;s likely the shield that Tony has is just one of the prototypes. As we see it is incomplete and very likely not made of Vibranium, the material of the actual shield. In the comics series, Stark had outfitted the shield with electronic components to enhance it&#39;s flight capabilities, i.e., to make it more accurate for Cap when he&#39;d throw it as a weapon. However, Cap decided later to have the electronics removed because he said they decreased the shield&#39;s accuracy. The shield shown in this movie could be a version of the electronically enhanced one and is meant to be an Easter Egg of sorts. Both this film and the previous both imply that Tony likes to drink heavily. In this film, Pepper asks, &quot;Are you drunk?&quot;, when Stark offers her the CEO position, and Stark also gets extremely drunk during a party later in the film and starts recklessly destroying things in his own house while wearing the Iron Man suit. This film addresses the alcoholism more directly than the first but no characters say conclusively that Tony has a drinking problem. And, as we see during the progression of the story, Tony stops drinking entirely to focus on creating his new element and stopping Justin Hammer &amp; Vanko.
