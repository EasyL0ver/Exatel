<?php
//a list of unknown size
$bars=array();
// I want to walk through the array and take the first one that isn't empty
//this code looks wierd but it's a compromise.
foreach ($bars as $bar) { if ($foo = $bar) { break 1; }

//this is what i wanted to do
while (!$foo = current($bars)) {
       next($bars);
}
//Im trying to say if $referrer isn't null to keep the loop open until current returns a non empty
//The problem is that this type of while loop seems to only work if im testing for a positive instead 
//of a negative because the negative just keeps the loop open forever.

//is my compromise the only adequate solution?
