Under the leadership of Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, or Nazi Party, grew into a mass movement and ruled Germany through totalitarian means from 1933 to 1945. Founded in 1919 as the German Workers’ Party, the group promoted German pride and anti-Semitism and expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the 1919 peace settlement that ended World War I (1914-1918) and required Germany to make numerous concessions and reparations. Hitler joined the party the year it was founded and became its leader in 1921. In 1933, he became chancellor of Germany and his Nazi government soon assumed dictatorial powers. After Germany’s defeat in World War II (1939-45), the Nazi Party was outlawed and many of its top officials were convicted of war crimes. After the recent immigration issue in Los Santos, a few supporters of the party have joined together in an attempt to create the Nationalist Socialist Party and restore it to its former glory.

Due to the strictness of the party, only people worthy of joining will be accepted. There will be background checks and interviews before anyone is accepted into the party. The party's main goal is to gain popularity among the people of Los Santos, by helping the community and law enforcement agencies, and keeping their amount of illegal activity to a minimum. The main goal will be to build a well respected and feared group.

The location of the Head Quarters has got to be one of the most important decisions made, deciding where the party will gather and thrive, and where the majority of future operations will take place for the party.

The main goal of the party will be to restore the name of the Party and to try and help Los Santos become a better place, where people can feel safe to walk around and get kids back onto the street, playing in the park and not having to worry about driveby's from rival gang's. While also improving relations with Law Enforcement and trying to prevent the upset of all LEA's by assisting them with help when help is needed.
