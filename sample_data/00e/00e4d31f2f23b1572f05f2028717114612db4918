ㅡ HOW DOES SHE FEEL ABOUT BEING A KOREAN TEENAGER LIVING IN ANOTHER COUNTRY? |  she feels at home because she was born there. She felt like she's lost when she went to Korea but just thought of positive things telling that she could survive. And she brought a bottle of milk with her so, that made her system calm. Milk is the only thing that can calm her down sometimes.

ㅡ DOES SHE HAVE ANY INTEREST IN KOREAN CULTURE? | yes. She wants to know everything about the country where she is so that atleast, when someone ask her out of nowhere, she could say something. 

ㅡ CAN SHE SPEAK KOREAN? | A total no no. Her parents did not teach her with the language so when she gets there, she needed someone to teach her Korean language (MINHOOOO). But she knows a few words -the basics. Well she listens to korean songs so she only know a few.

ㅡ LOVE INTEREST | Minho
ㅡ FIRST IMPRESSIONS | Esme thought he couldn't speak at all because he's quiet when she first saw him. She realized that he's not that serious when they get along after days in the camp.
ㅡ SUGGESTED SCENES WITH L/I | min. 2
>Esme was laying in a mat watching the clear blue sky. She sat up and observed to look for something she could draw because she's getting bored. She doesn't have someone to talk to because they talk in Korean and not English. She saw a guy sitting under a big, shady tree, holding a maple leaf whil staring at it. She remembered something in a Maple leaf but just chose not to think about it because she couldn't remember it. She immediately looked for her sketch pad, pencil, coloring materials, etc etc and started scribbling at the paper. He's not moving so it's very easy for her to draw the scenario. At night. She was laying again in the mat, watching the night sky. She wants to listen to a song but she just couldnt because it's one of the rules that gadgets are not allowed. She reached for the sketch pad at the upper part of her head but she couldn't find it. She decided to sit down and when she looked for it, it was already in someone's hands. Minho's hands. The guy who was in the drawing.

>Esme was having difficulty talking to the other campers because of the language barrier. she doesn't know how to talk in Korean so she tried to convince Minho to teach him the language. She sticked with him until he said yes. She couldn't ask Her few friends to teach her because they too don't know how to speak the language.

ㅡ FRIENDS | Melbourne and Rio
ㅡ SUGGESTED SCENES WITH FRIENDS |
>When Esme (London), (Melbourne), and (Rio) met, they first had a noisy start. Esme tried to be as bubbly as she can because she wants to have someone she's close to already. She tried to talk to (Melbourne) but she just ignored Esme (London). Esme omce again introduced herself but she just ignored her again. (Rio) was walking and suddenly, she steps on (London's) foot. She said sorry and Esme (London) accepted it but Melbourne murmurmed "Sorry is not enough." (Rio) heard that and the fight started. (London) was stopping them and they eventually stopped and apologized to each other... (idk whay i'm laughjng at this)
>Esme (London) had a conspiracy with (Melbourne). The bubbly one will wake up the sleepy head. (Melbourne) watched Esme (London) shout "The camp is on fiiiree!" In a Bts Fire tune. She didn't wake up and she did it again, in Playing With Fire tune and there. she woke up with a frown in her face.
