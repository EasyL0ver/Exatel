When Earth is invaded deep beneath the Pacific Ocean from a portal between dimensions in a breach by creatures called Kaijus, the governments join forces and realize that only monsters could destroy the Kaijus. The mankind builds the ultimate machines known as Jaegers, huge robots neurally controlled by two compatible pilots that have their minds interlocked. Years after, Kaijus become more powerful and a scientist discovers that they are part of an alien plan to destroy mankind first and exhaust the planet after. The former pilot Raleigh Becket, who lost his older brother Yancy Becket in a battle against a Kaiju, is summoned by Marshall Stacker Pentecost to fight again together with the rookie Mako Mori in the last hope of mankind.
As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.
I don&#39;t understand, was it a video game or a comic from the 80&#39;s? These things were good 50 yrs back.... this movie does not explain many things - if the aliens are that smart to create a portal or something to travel to Earth for invasion - then y??---<br/><br/>1) They still look like primitive dinosaurs???? 2) they don&#39;t have a weapon to fight with other than just being huge sized???? 3) y from beginning the forces of earth are not attacking the place where aliens enter the earth??? rather than waiting for them to come to the cities????? 4) Y characters do not act in this movie? 5) The pace and events of the movie are stupid and non-exciting because u r used to these from many other movies like transformers, terra nova etc...
A movie of this nature would be regarded as a &quot;cheesy, plot less flick&quot; filled with just clumsy action scenes that really have no basis. However, after I got out of the cinema I could not get over how pumped I felt.<br/><br/>In all honesty this movie makes for an action packed summer blockbuster that deserves appraisal and excels in an intricate plot line as well as pure fist-pumping thrill when it comes to Monsters vs. Machines. After all the majority of us miss out on movies that are on such a high scale proportion such as Godzilla and Jurassic Park and it seems that directors and producers shun these movies due to the fear that they may not achieve success. Big props to Guillermo del Toro for making the movie come to life as well as solid performances from the lead cast such as Idris Elba as well as Charlie Hunnam which really puts together a solid blockbuster that is worthwhile to watch.
It is one of the better dumbass sci-fi action movies to come down the pike in quite some time.
Twelve years after the opening of a breach under the Pacific Ocean has allowed giant, reptilian creatures called Kaiju to emerge from another dimension, the attacks of the Kaiju have escalated and the army of massive robots called Jaegers built to fight them have proven unsuccessful. In a desperate attempt to save mankind, the head of the Jaeger program Stacker Pentecost (<a href="/name/nm0252961/">Idris Elba</a>) decides to reactivate four Jaegers and summons former Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket (<a href="/name/nm0402271/">Charlie Hunnam</a>) to pilot the Gipsy Danger. Because of the massive size of the Jaegers, however, they require two compatible pilots with their minds neurally interlocked, referred to as &quot;drifting&quot;, in order to control the robots. After sparring with Pentecost&#39;s adopted daughter Mako Mori (<a href="/name/nm0452860/">Rinko Kikuchi</a>), Becket decides that he wants to &quot;drift&quot; with her, but Pentecost refuses. Meanwhile, the Kaiju attacks continue to intensify. Pacific Rim is based on a story and screenplay by American screenwriter Travis Beacham and Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, who also directed the movie. It&#39;s explained in the film, and further in the prequel comic, that the neural strain of controlling a 250-foot-tall robot is just too much for one person to handle. Each pilot controls one side of the robot, left or right, similar to how humans use their brain hemispheres to control each side of their bodies. For more information, view Guillermo del Toro explaining it here. It could also be because of the intense concentration required to control the Jaegers: if one pilot loses focus, the other pilot can take over for a period of time. Even though not factual, it also adds a story element of team work to add some complexity to the human factor of the Jaegers and adds some additional story elements regarding the mind melding of two people. After all, much of the core of the story is about humanity working together to overcome a seemingly impossible problem, so this is a good way to illustrate that theme. No. As explained in the film, the rift was a portal between two dimensions. That it appeared to be going downwards is misleading. The kaiju started getting bigger and attacking more often. Apparently, the early successes were on Class 1 and 2 kaiju. As stated in the film, the kaiju class system was based on the size and mass of the kaiju. Class 3 and higher kaiju were apparently more powerful than the existing jaeger technology. Also, every kaiju win meant dead jaeger pilots, and they were more difficult to replace than the jaegers. Also, at one point, it did appear that multiple jaegers were used at one time. Raleigh refers to &quot;standard, two jaeger battle formation&quot; during the final battle, but all the fights shown except one only had one jaeger. This more likely refers to a lack of pilots than a lack of jaegers. The alien species that created the kaiju quite obviously was learning from the battles they lost so they began to engineer larger and more aggressive monsters that had new physical features the jaeger teams wouldn&#39;t be expecting. The &quot;knife-head&quot; kaiju that Raleigh and his brother fight at the beginning of the movie seemed to be designed to stab a jaeger with its forehead, a body part specifically created for that purpose. The tail of the kaiju that destroys the Crimson Typhoon was designed to grab the head of the jaeger and crush it, killing the team. Also, it is mentioned that all Kaiju&#39;s brains are connected, so other Kaiju can watch how the Jaeger fight and learn/evolve to destroy them more effectively. It&#39;s difficult to see what happens to Yancy (<a href="/name/nm1459109/">Diego Klattenhoff</a>), Raleigh&#39;s brother and drifting partner, when he&#39;s torn from the control module, but it looks like the kaiju got hold of Yancy&#39;s pilot harness and yanked him out that way. From that point, Yancy was likely thrown aside or dropped by the kaiju or simply slid off the kaiju&#39;s claw. If that had happened, he&#39;d have fallen to his death in the water since a drop from that height is deadly, even on water. However, that is a convention in big-budget movies that is often cheated. For the purposes of the story here, Yancy is most likely dead. Raleigh was able to survive the crash landing because he was still attached to his control harness. Dropping a nuclear bomb in the middle of a large city would be an absolute last resort, as this would easily cause as much if not more damage than a giant, rampaging monster. Plus the contamination from the fallout would be catastrophic and unpredictable, not only in the immediate blast zone but also to the rest of the world with nuclear fallout spreading according to climate and wind patterns. In the prequel comic, it is explained that the first four kaiju to attack were, in fact, destroyed with nuclear weapons. The fourth kaiju, &quot;Scissure&quot;, which attacked Sydney, apparently took several days to lure out to sea where it could be safely nuked without decimating and contaminating all of Sydney along with it. It is precisely for this reason that the Jaeger program was developed because, if humanity had to continue to drop nukes every time a kaiju showed up, that would wipe out the human race all on its own, not to mention the catastrophic damage to Earth itself. Guillermo del Toro has stated that he does not intend Pacific Rim to be a &quot;realistic&quot; depiction of a giant monster invasion. Rather he intends the film to be a &quot;beautiful poem to giant monsters&quot;; that is, a stylized throwback to the giant monster genre. Also, as explained in the film, conventional weapons caused the kaiju&#39;s blood to contaminate the environment, a condition known as &quot;kaiju blue.&quot; Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha (and to some extent the Striker Eureka,) faced off against the two kaiju and were surprised by the monsters&#39; larger size, more aggressive nature, and new tactics. Also, it appears that the kaiju had a lot of experience vs these jaegers and that these particular kaiju were designed just to defeat them. This was also the first time any jaegers had fought two kaiju at the same time (remember how Geizler and Gottlieb talked emphatically about the double and triple events?), which is what caused Cherno Alpha&#39;s defeat. The flying kaiju&#39;s tail seemed to be designed to destroy the heads of jaegers, which easily killed the Crimson Typhoon team. Once these new features were used, however, the surprise factor was eliminated, and Gipsy Danger was able to anticipate and counter them. Additionally, Gipsy Danger had new features that the kaiju were unaware of, in particular the chain sword, so Gipsy also had the element of surprise. This is a little hard to answer for sure, because we don&#39;t know the extent of the damage or disrepair that other Jaegers might have suffered. It could be that they always meant or hoped to repair other Jaegers, and that Gipsy Danger was simply
