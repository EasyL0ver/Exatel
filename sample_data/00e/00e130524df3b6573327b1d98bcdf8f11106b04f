I had originally written something longer, but so many things changed so quickly that I decided to make it short and simple.

My first video was published on August 22, 2016.
My last video was published on September 20, 2018.

Two years may not seem like a long time for most people, but for me, it is a lifetime.

Everything is cancelled.

I am leaving, Discord, YouTube, Twitter, Steam, Everything. I used to enjoy it, I really did, but that all changed a few months back. It hurts to leave it all behind, but it is for the best.

I have given my accounts to my brother, for him to do with as he pleases. I couldn’t care less what he does with them, use them, delete them, get them banned, I don’t care anymore, Just don’t give him shit if you run into him, he doesn’t need to become involved with my past.

Thank you to those who were there for me.

Max, Thank you for being there, from the beginning to the end.

Tim, Thanks for showing me that you can’t always trust someone based on how popular they are.

Devon, Even though we had occasional beef, you were pretty cool. 

Bars, Matthew, Ray, TB, All of you from the original crew where everything started, I don’t know if you are still out there, but if you see this, I miss you guys so much!

I know there are a few people I missed, sorry for that.

I’m out of stuff to say, so I will just sum it up in one word.




Goodbye
