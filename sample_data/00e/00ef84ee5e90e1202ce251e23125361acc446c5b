i know like
a few danish words and that's it
kat og katten
that's cat and the cat
grøn
is green
blå is blue
but honestly like
the norwegian languages are so similar that u can just wing it through reading it if u know one of them
except for finnish
finnish is a mess

Emmy - Today at 03:59
damn
gron and bla remind me of like
swedish

Kelpsye - Today at 03:59
wait i'm a dumb
norwegian languages
i meant nordic
yeah
like
like let's use brigittes ult line for example
alla till mig
in icelandic that's allir til mig
and in danish it's alle til mig
and in norwegian it's also alle til mig

Emmy - Today at 04:04
wow

Kelpsye - Today at 04:04
u see what i mean by how u can just wing it with reading it

Emmy - Today at 04:04
yeah that's really close

Kelpsye - Today at 04:05
it's like that for like
i'd say 75% of words
and that's being conservative
like let's use another phrase
i love you
in icelandic it's
ég elska þig
in danish it's jeg elsker dig
norwegian is jeg elsker deg
and swedish jag älskar dig
icelandic is the biggest outlier but it's still super similar
é is just je
like a sentence is always similar to atleast one of the other languages i'd say
where are all the bitches in icelandic is
hvar eru allar tíkurnar
in danish it's hvor er alle tæverne
norwegian is hvor er alle tislene
and swedish is var är alla tikarnar
like u see how icelandic and swedish are really similar
there's almost always at least one connection that's really similar
icelandic is almost always the biggest outlier tho since the other languages have evolved way more than icelandic has and icelandic has so many grammar rules
and then there's fucking finnish that just has to be fucking unique

Emmy - Today at 04:14
jl.
holy shit*

Kelpsye - Today at 04:14
everyone to me in finish is kaikki minulle
i love you is Minä rakastan sinua
where are all the bitches is missä ovat kaikki nartut
LIKE IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE OTHER LANGUAGES

Emmy - Today at 04:15
finish is the uwu special snowflake

Kelpsye - Today at 04:15
Yeah!
god sorry for fucking writing an essay

Emmy - Today at 04:15
omg no don't apologize
I never knew that stuff

Kelpsye - Today at 04:16
like
icelandic has barely fucking evolved
it's the language that's most close to old norse
like people who only know modern day icelandic can easily read way way way way way old icelandic
icelandic is dumb
i don't know what greenlandic is like tho also
also åland islands just speaks swedish
and faroe island speaks faroese which is also similar to the other shit
if i remember correctly it's the one most similar to icelandic
like
a mix of icelandic and danish

Emmy - Today at 04:22
greenlandic
damn

Kelpsye - Today at 04:23
wait no faroese is like
80-90% icelandic and the rest is danish
icelandic and faroese are the only nordic languages to have genders
like check the grammar section on the wikipedia page for it
it's so similar to icelandic
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroese_language#Grammar
i really like talking about languages hghhghgkhghkdfg
oh also i googled it and greenlandic is an inuit language so ehhhhh
not at all like the other languages
i hope u found my ramblings interesting
