OLX is an online marketplace for buying and selling locally, absolutely for free! You are not obligated to sign up for an account and can buy and sell as you please. However it is easier to sign up for an account as you can manage your ads, messages, information, personal account and favorites from one location.

What is great about OLX is that it is easy to post items, upload pictures and modify your ads. Once you are done you can even share your ad on all your  major networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. Currrently, OLX is fInformationresh on the market in the U.S., so it is not saturated like Craigslist. This is an advantage as competition is minimal at the moment. If you are really interested in featuring your ads there is an option for that. Of course it does require your credit card information. For now I wouldnâ€™t recommend it.

The disadvantage is, the advertiser is responsible for taking down the ads once they are over. Although you may notice there are some ads from 2012. This to me seems a nuisance since you need to pay attention to the dates of the ad posting. I hope that OLX will fix this issue in the future.
