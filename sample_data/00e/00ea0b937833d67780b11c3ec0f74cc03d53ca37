Crouched atop ancient stones holding vigil, staunch against memories fade, a single red eyed raven bore silent witness to her birth. Unblinking, unflinching, unwavering witness to the horror of her glory.

Clad in a misting blackness with skin of shaded moonlight, she walked on velvet, her head covered in cowl of deadly red. She emerged from the glistening pool of emerald, each step graceful in power, her cape shimmering silently about her figure, her horns curving in a vicious helix, her mouth slobbering rabidly… Her body wet and dripping with the after-birth of a long forgotten species.

Pausing at pools edge she shook herself ferociously, showering ground, stones and raven with a vile torrent. Shocked, the raven rose screaming, and took to wings of night. She snarled with teeth bared as she watched him go. His cry would wake the dead. She smiled grimly, relishing the thought that even in death they were not safe from her devouring mind.

Dropping to all fours she arched her back, and muttered a dark word. The silent shimmering cape folded down around her body, wrapping tightly to her figure, flowing about every curve, clinging and transforming them both into a new shape… a giant black cat with eyes of shifting colors ever-changing.

Shaking itself once more, the cat paused to listen, ears twisting this way and that. Suddenly it leapt atop the stones, dashed across them with a bound, and vanished into the gloaming silent night.
