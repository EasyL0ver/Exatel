You&rsquo;ve tried to bury it and run away from it, to no avail. Whatever this thing is that haunts you can&rsquo;t be slain with a sword or banished with a spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from most people and making you question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys you.</p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p><strong><span>Skill Proficiencies:</span></strong>&nbsp;Choose&nbsp;two of Arcana, Investigation, Religion, or Survival</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Languages:</span></strong>&nbsp;Choose one exotic language (Abyssal, Celestial, Deep Speech, Draconic, Infernal, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon)</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Equipment:</span></strong>&nbsp;Monster hunter&rsquo;s pack (see sidebar), one trinket of special significance (choose one or roll on the Gothic Trinkets table in this&nbsp;appendix)</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>MONSTER HUNTER'S PACK</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can buy a monster hunter&rsquo;s pack for 33 gp, which is cheaper than buying the items in it individually.

Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.</p>\r\n<h5>Harrowing Event</h5>\r\n<p>Prior to becoming an adventurer, your path in life was defined by one dark moment, one fateful decision, or one tragedy. Now you feel a darkness threatening to consume you, and you fear there may be no hope of escape. Choose a harrowing event that haunts you, or roll one on the Harrowing Events table.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Harrowing Event</strong></p>\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th style=\"text-align:center\"><span>d10</span></th>\r\n<th><span>Event</span></th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td>A monster that slaughtered dozens of innocent people spared your life, and you don&rsquo;t know why.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>You were born under a dark star.
