                                                                 IGN: TigerKanzai
                                                             Why do i want 2nd Raikage:

                                                 I would like to have the rank 2nd Raikage for many reasons cause
                                                 i like how the Raikages move with there fast speed. And ofcourse i like the 2nd
                                                 Raikage personality he has a strong will to protect kumogakure and dats
                                                 how i feel i want to be. And i want dat strenght he owns the 2nd raikage
                                                 before he even was Raikage he had incredible strenght strong inuf to be
                                                 hes predecessors guard. He was also known for hes intelligence so i like
                                                 dat alot of hes personality.
              
                                                 Hes politics were very good he started a peace with the Hidden Leaf and with 
                                                 with those actions he helped out Kumo alot but to bad for them Gold and silver
                                                 brother ambushed them and i like the fact dat nobody knows what happend to the
                                                 Hokage but they know dat the Raikage A easily escaped.     
                                                 
                                                 I like the 2nd raikage A apperance alot he doesnt look like any kind of shinobi or
                                                 2nd raikage also has black hair wich he wore in a peculiar style
                                                 I like how he has a modern
                                                 Kumo jacket with medals on it to show people hes achievements. 
                                                 and in the game i think i would be a good addition for the Kumo if we go in war
                                                 I dont really roleplay but if needed i will
