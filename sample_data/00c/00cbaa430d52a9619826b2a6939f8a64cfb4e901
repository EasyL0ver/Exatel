:(Chakra Nature 1): Wind Release, by performing the tiger handsign alone Faizel is granted access to all of his wind release techniques while only performing a singly hand sign.
 
-​​[ Futon Release; Co2 Concentrate Increase​ ] Through his mastery in wind release Faizel created a technique in which allowed him to increase the concentrate of carbon dioxide in the air while also decreasing the concentrate of oxygen causing harm to ones inner anatomy. With the increase Co2 and Decrease in o2 one would find themselves becoming weaker in the matter of minutes, only for their organs to begin to fail and shut down killing an opponent from the inside. (20 yards/ 60 feet)(Tiger-rabbit-dog Hand sign)

[ Futon Release; O2 Concentrate increase ] Faizel is able to manipulate the flow of Oxygen increasing the concentrate of oxygen by infusing it with his Chakra. In doing so those within a 10Miles radius or closer proximity of the jutsu would be effected. Two major effects of this technique is the increase of oxygen would cause great deal of pressure onto the targets lungs and heart as the levels of carbon monoxide increases in the body tissue. As a result the airways begin to swell up causing even less air to enter the lungs eventually subduing to heart failure or suffocation. Faizel can also manipulate the shaping of the air, creating a sphere like structure around his opponents head in order to bring about death faster than its usual technical effect. (20 yards/ 60 feet)(Tiger-dragon-ox Hand sign)


[ Futon Release; Invisble Slicer ] Faizel can simply with a of wave his hand or even with the flick of a finger sending a violent blade of wind towards the opponent, the wind is subdue with a vacuum like affect from his master in wind release completely erasing sound. Granted, being that the technique is also the manipulation of air, it would come as an surprise to any opponent giving off a form of semi invisibility conveying little visual representation, making the it the ultimate stealth attack. If one is to find themselves in contact with the violent wind blade would result in the severing of the said limb, completely slicing through and detaching it from the body.  (Tiger-rat-snake Hand sign)

[ Futon Release; Pressure ] This sphere-like mass is compressed until it has a very high density before being released. The blast can hit a vast range, inflicting massive damage on both the target and their close surroundings. (Tiger-rat-ox Hand sign)


[ Futon Release; Lung Adaptation ] Faizels lungs acclimatize and breathe in/on any gaseous mediums, whether hostile or deficient, Faizel lungs also filter away non-gaseous substances such as dust, asbestos, etc. He can breathe toxic gases instead of oxygen and survive mountain, aerial, or terrine air deficiency, which are among the longest and most painful deaths the average human can suffer.(Tiger Hand sign, only needs to perform one hand seal)


[ Futon Release; Air Walk ] Faizel can walk on the air, treating it like a solid matter. He can run and move across the air as if walking on the ground, giving him greater maneuverability in his environment.(Tiger-Snake-Rat Hand sign)

:(Chakra Nature 2): Earth Release, By performing the dog hand sign just like his wind release techniques he only needs to perform one hand seal to access any of his earth techniques.

[ Earth Release; Quick Sand ] Faizel is able to transform earth properties into quicksand or can manipulate pre-existing sand to function as Quicksand. This is primarily used to subdue, bind, trap someone, sink objects/people, etc.(Dog-rat-tiger Handsign)

[ Earth Release; Burrowing Technique ] Faizel can hide underground to evade attacks and for underground travel, as well as launch surprise attacks. While Burrowing underground Faizel can weaken ground structure, creating traps or pitfalls.(Dog Handsign)
 
[ Earth Release; Sensory Field ] Faizel is able to pick up even the slightest vibrations through physical contact with the ground, enabling him to perceive his surroundings as precisely as normal sight. Faizel is able to sense the structure and materials of solid substances, including the presence of caves, material changes, structural weaknesses, etc. (Dog-rat, places hands on the ground Handsign)

[ Earth Release; Splitting Earth Technique ] By slamming his hands onto the ground and exerting chakra into the earth, Faizel is capable of splitting the ground beneath the opponents feet, causing them to fall into a deep underground pit.(Dog-rat-tiger Handsign)

[ Earth Release; Forest Of Stone Spikes ] By shaping and manipulating the earths surface, Faizel is capable of manifesting a large forest of spiked rocks in which cover a large distance of the surrounding area, any caught within the said emergence of the stoned forest is to be pierced by sharp spikes and turned into stone before crumbling.(Dog-snake-tiger-rat Handsign)

[ Earth Release; Weighed boulder Technique ] A technique which enhances the targets gravity at Faizel's discretion. The enemy's mobility is diminished, as the person is crushed by gravity and in some cases exhibit petrification-like symptoms and then began to crumble. Using a desert region to his advantage, Faizel can easily bury the enemy alive by submerging them in sand. When this technique is applied to Faizel it decreases their speed, but the increased weight drastically improves their strength. This method makes it possible for even a weak person to land a devastating hit.(Dog Handsign)

[ Earth Release; Earth Spear ]  Faizel flows chakra through all parts of his body causing it to become noticeably darker, which increases his defensive power to its utmost limits by making the skin as hard as rock, easily capable of withstanding most attacks with little to no damage. As a result, the amount of techniques that can break through the areas hardened by the Earth Spear are close to zero, excluding its undeniable weak point: Lightning Release ninjutsu. Furthermore, the destructive power of physical attacks is increased, making this a great all-purpose technique.(Dog Handsign then manifest a spear from earthly material)

Earth Release; Earth Style Wall ] Faizel creates a solid wall of earth as a form of defence. Chakra is either converted to earth within the body and then spat out to form the wall or Faizel can manipulate pre-existing earth to form the wall. The earth then  rises up and takes form.(Dog Handsign)

:(Chakra Nature 3): Fire Release (locked)

-[ Fire Release; Flaming Wall ] A technique where Faizel chakra is kneaded inside his body is converted into fire, and then expelled from the mouth in a massive wall of intense flames, which covers an expansive range. This makes the technique extremely difficult to either avoid or contain, with it requiring the combined efforts of several Water Release users in order to extinguish the flames.(Rabbit-Tiger-Dog)

[ Fire Release; Flaming Dragon Head ] A jutsu was developed by Faizen in which the he  compresses a large amount of chakra built up inside his body and changes it into a dragon-shaped fireball. Faizen then skillfully manipulates that great fire, and attacks his opponent with it. The flames exude a very high temperature, as they can create an upward movement of air currents which can give rise to thunder clouds. A master of this technique can fire off several flames in succession and anyone caught in the technique could potentially be reduced to ashes. (Rabbit-dragon)
