Really cause two hours ago he was telling me you hate him then last night his lame attempt at saying sorry which was not real at all he was just doing it to please you

i don't hate him. i just lost interests in him. and at times, i don't hold a grudge. yeah, he may be two faced.  we do call each other names at times. he might be talking behind my back, but noone is showing me the screen shots of it.

if you turn on me, would hurt a bit cuz you and i are actual friends. Turtle and I don't have what you and I have/had. and no, i don't see the point you are making. i'm dense at times

I can't stand him and I won't be apart of anything that includes him so that will he mostly all your pulses 
4 minutes ago

me
if he turns on me, it won't hurt me at all. he would be just another person on pulse. just like everyone else is just a random person. i know you can't stand him and i'm fine with that. i'm not asking you to be nice to him or be friends with him. i don't talk about your friends. cuz you are a grown woman that choose yourself. i mean, i didn't like you were friends with Corpsessed cuz how he told people to kill themselves. i kept quiet  cuz it's not right of me to tell you to drop him. that's for you to decide.
