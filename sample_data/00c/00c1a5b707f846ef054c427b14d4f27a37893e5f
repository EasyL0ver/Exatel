Big news: I've been in the process of moving into my first apartment, which has been nerve wracking, over the last couple of weeks. It's been exhausting, but having access to the apartment and being able to move stuff in slowly has been amazing. All it's missing is a couch, table, some chairs and food + various odds and ends that I may have missed. I'm moving in most of the big furniture I own from my old apartment today. Then on August 2nd-5th, I'll be at GenCon ( A tabletop convention). After I come back, I'll buy the couch and the rest of the stuff. After I move my desk+computer today, I have to decide if I want to live in a non-complete apartment or stay home with no computer.
