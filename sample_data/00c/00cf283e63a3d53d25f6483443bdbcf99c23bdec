WORKS:
$sql = 'WITH table1_ids AS (SELECT ID FROM table1 WHERE criterion="1")
		SELECT * FROM table2 WHERE reference1 IN (SELECT * FROM table1_ids)
		UNION
		SELECT * FROM table2 WHERE reference2 IN (SELECT * FROM table1_ids)';
$stmt = static::$pdo->prepare($sql);
$stmt->execute();

FAILS:
$sql = 'WITH table1_ids AS (SELECT ID FROM table1 WHERE criterion=?)
		SELECT * FROM table2 WHERE reference1 IN (SELECT * FROM table1_ids)
		UNION
		SELECT * FROM table2 WHERE reference2 IN (SELECT * FROM table1_ids)';
$stmt = static::$pdo->prepare($sql); // $stmt === false
$stmt->execute(['1'])
