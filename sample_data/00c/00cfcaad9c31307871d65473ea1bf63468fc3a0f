CHARACTER INFORMATION
Universe: SCP
Character Name: Maria Octavia Rosales
Character Species: Human
Character Gender: Female
Character Age (Nothing under 18): 35
Character Height: Five feet eight inches (in armor, roughly 6'1)

Abilities:

Special Forces Training
Both from her time in the Spanish GEO counter-terrorism unit and in the Global Occult Coalition, Maria is trained in:
- CQC
- First Aid
- Small-arms marksmanship
- Maintaining calm and collected in combat situations
- Squad tactics


GOC Education
The GOC is well equipped to handle paranormal threats of many types, and as such Maria is aware of the information stored within this page:
www.scp-wiki.net/goc-supplemental-humanoid-guide
Which provides tactics on dealing with various paranormal threats such as shape-shifters, re-animators, and thus will try to use them against suitable paranormal threats - of course, if the threat uses something completely unlike what is outlined there, this information isn't of much use.
This is just to cover my ass in the event of meta accusations if the weakness of a target's type and one listed in that page line up.




Memetic Agent Inoculation
Mind is hardened against memetic agents, such as those employed by other SCP-universe agencies that would cause confusion or even death. This specific thing does not protect against magic mind control or such things, just memetics from their universe.


Weaknesses:
- Under all the gear, is still just an ordinary human with all of the weaknesses associated.
- Equipment is specialized for the paranormal, and thus is cripplingly overspecialized when it comes to threats of a non-paranormal nature, such as a super soldier augmented to hell with technology or a giant with an equally giant hammer.
- The above of course also applies to energy and ballistic weaponry exceeding the protective quality of the armor.
- Offensive weaponry is likely not going to be up to snuff vs other common universes


EQUIPMENT INFORMATION

Armor:

MKII Combat Garment ('White Suit')

The white suit of primarily composed of two parts, with or with the future chance for attached features:

The undergarment is a close-fitting suit worn under everything else that provides:
- Typical Type IIIA protection (3 shots of) to the torso
- A water cooling system to keep the user at proper temperature at all times.

The battle armor is worn on top:
- It provides acceptable ballistic protection - roughly 30 7.62x30 rifle rounds to penetrate.
- Provides fine protection vs slashes and stabs
- An exoskeleton within enables the user to lift up to 325 pounds on its own, and absorb the recoil from firing contemporary automatic weaponry
- A full HAZMAT system, which protects the user from radiation, corrosive acids (but not melty-plasma mind you) and gas.



There is also a cloaking module that bends light around the user and their gear, rendering them invisible to the eye and typical cameras.
The stealth is far from perfect - advanced vision such as thermals, sonar, or some sort of person-sensing 'sixth sense' can tell that the agent is there just fine.
As well, the armor itself is quite 'clanky', and can be heard at medium-close ranges by anyone with working ears. While it can be used indefinitely, it serves its user best at longer ranges for quick traversal across sightlines.

The entire armor has a self destruct module that the user can activate which will let loose miniature explosives that will attempt to destroy the armor completely so that it cannot be recovered upon death or capture of the agent, provided said agent can activate it in time that is. Besides bits of shrapnel from flying armor pieces, the self destruct doesn't pose too much danger to others nearby, as it's just made to brick the armor.




Weapons:

M4A1 Rifle
> Fires 5.56 NATO rounds
> 30+1 box magazine
> Short range Reflex sight
> Nothing else special here


Glock 17c
> Fires .40 S&W rounds
> 10+1 magazine

Knife
> A sturdy, steel combat knife.





General Equipment:



Scranton Reality Anchor
This curious device can either be worn or placed on the ground, and activated by a paired remote or button on the device itself. It is not small enough to be placed in a pocket, but fits on the belt.

When activated, the Scranton Reality Anchor will enforce normalcy within a five meter radius. This means that any abilities of paranormal nature will immediately be suppressed and will not work at all, while beings that are almost entirely paranormal (such as a ghost) will be crippled and weakened. This only covers the paranormal - abilities granted by non-paranormal means will not be affected. Obviously, bullets and energy weaponry are also not affected whatsoever. This effect will last four combat turns, upon which the field drops instantly and anything hindered will be able to act again. The reality anchor will then need to recharge, which will not occur until combat has concluded, plus some rest time.

To further clarify what is considered 'paranormal', here are some examples of the anchor will and will not prevent - not meant to be exhaustive.

Will Anchor:
- The Force
- The Warp
- Fantasy Magic of any kind
- Most forms of telekinetics
- Telepathy
- Reality warpers
- Any SCPs and their anomalous abilities
- STALKER artifacts and anomalies
- The 'magic' in any 'magi-tech'
- Jojo Stands

Will Not Anchor:
- Prototype Evolved (it's a disease that biologically changes their body)
- Mass Effect Biotics (The use of eezo and biotics is not an anomalous thing, but just some sci-fi science)
- Tech augments of any kind

etc, etc...

They're flashbangs.


VERTIAS Vision System

A visor that can either be attached to the White Suit's armor or worn on its own, the visor itself comes with Low-Light (NV), and Infared vision optics.
The VERITAS itself reads the Aetheric Energy Fields (AEF) or Elan Vital Energy (EVE) that is given off by all living beings, and puts this data together to report the results to the wearer.
The end result of this is that any being or object that is currently exhibiting paranormal function or ability with the same criteria as the Reality Anchor can be identified and tracked, even through walls and other solid obstacles.

This means that if someone is currently using or is powered by a paranormal ability, they can be tracked. If they stop using them, the device will stop reading them.
