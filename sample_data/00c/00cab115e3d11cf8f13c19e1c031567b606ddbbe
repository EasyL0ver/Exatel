[11:26] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): I need to know if there would be any issue from the staff with a former ST and still current sim owner from Nocturne coming to play.
[11:26] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): Why would that be a problem?
[11:26] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): I just don't want anyone getting the wrong idea about why I'm here.
[11:27] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): We're not gonna stop or forbid anyone from playing anywhere or doing what they like to do.
[11:27] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): But our system is different from Nocturne's.
[11:28] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): I know.
[11:28] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): You use the d10 sys and tt rules
[11:28] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): would allow someone to come in built out of the Gypsy book?
[11:29] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): We're currently reviewing Gypsies, I believe.
[11:30] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): there have been several requests.
[11:30] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): Really?
[11:30] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): That's great.
[11:30] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): I don't really care for playing a mage and that's the closest I could get to what my character is.
[11:30] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel) nods
[11:32] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): That's... hopeful actually.
[11:32] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): Hopeful?
[11:33] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): A good thing.  Pulls my attention towards you guys more and makes me feel a bit less like a traitor for even thinking about coming to play.
[11:34] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): I'm not where i can dig in to the website just yet... is there an age or gen limit for kindred?
[11:35] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): I'd like to point out that we're not really concerned with Nocturne. What they do is on them, and that's fine. We're not here to be the biggest or the best, it isn't a competition. Traitor is a really nasty word, and I'm sorry you feel put upon by it. We don't hold players here, they can come and go as they please.
[11:35] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): There is. 8th gen is the Max.
[11:35] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): That's doable.
[11:35] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): Easily.
[11:36] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): I can easily adapt my Gangrel to that.
[11:37] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): What about age ranks Neonate, Ancilla, Elder?
[11:37] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): That requires 5 out of your seven backround points.
[11:37] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): Are those in play?  And how are they broken up?
[11:37] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): Nobody comes in with higher than 2 in clan status.
[11:38] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): Ok.  I can work with that too.
[11:40] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): Sweet. The court as it stands is NPC run, and you know about the Gangrel claiming Independence from the Cam, yeah?
[11:40] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): Xavier took them back in 20th.
[11:41] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): But yes I did know and my Grel stood against that and was a staunch Cam supporter.
[11:42] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): Going ot have to adapt her some if the hubs does want to come play but over the almost 10 years I've played her, she's become an archon and quite often tells Xavier he was an idiot for pulling out of the cam.
[11:43] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): Okay. Just wanted to make sure. It may be a bit hard for you to earn status initially, but obviously the more you rally to the cause the more the Cam will accept you, so on and so forth.
[11:43] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): So you guys aren't playing out of V20 then.  Which ed are you using?
[11:46] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): V20 is when the Gangrel left, isn't it? Am I crossing my streams here?
[11:46] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): You are.
[11:46] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): The Grangrel left in 2nd ed or 2nd revised.
[11:47] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): V20 is when Xavier brought the Gangrel back in to the am.
[11:47] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): CAm*
[11:47] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): We're using V20 rules. Ahh, shit, haha. Well, then scratch that, hah.
[11:47] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): LOL
[11:47] Ϯ Gуρşч ღ ℜαɠє Ϯ (gypsy.inada): It's ok.  I was still under the impression they were out until I started really digging in to V20.
[11:48] Valeria Laelia Silvanus (eloriel): Oh god, I'll have to read deeper into the fluff lol
