An ensemble of two Nyeshk Katanas. The hilts of each are wrapped in wrapped in red cloth, with gold tassels coming out of the pommels. Upon each ornate but heavy nyeshk blade golden dragons are spotted running down the metal which is shined to a bright reflective polish. "Pumpkin 1510AC" is engraved into one blade in a fancy gold lettering with a golden thumbprint upon the shined metal right below it denoting a makers mark. On the other "Nyaightbringers~" is also engraved in the similar lettering. The scabbards for each are just plain black Nyeshk, also equally heavy.
