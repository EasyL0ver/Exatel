Propane in a tank is a combo of mostly liquid with vapor above it. When you open the valve, the gas vapor flows out. This vapor is what you burn. When the vapor leaves the tank, the vapor pressure inside the tank drops, and some more of the propane liquid turns from liquid to vapor to replace it. This results in a temperature drop (going from liquid to gas) just like sweating on your skin does. A tank in use forms a frost line at the level of fluid inside due to this temperature drop (a handy way to see how much propane is left).

If the vapor being used is less than the rate at which the surface area of the propane liquid in the tank can evaporate and replace it, then you get a steady-state flame (like in a BBQ). If the vapor is being used at a greater rate than can be replaced, then you get an initial blast of flame followed by a much lesser amount (like a small torch). In the latter case you will also likely run into issues with freezing the regulator.

To get a bigger blast, you need to either use a bigger tank (more surface area for evaporation) or use an accumulator. An accumulator is a pressure tank (re-dangerous) hooked in-line with the propane tank before the main operation valve. This allows a larger volume of vapor to accumulate than can normally accumulatre inside the propane tank. You will still freeze your regulator / tank set-up if you run it too often. To prevent that typically requires a warm water bath (which gets even more dangerous when using pressurized gases). At this stage, you really need to know what you are doing to avoid hurting yourself or others (there are safety checks on Playa, working with the Pyro team way ahead of time is advised). Your best bet to learn how to do this sort of stuff is to spend some time working with someone who already knows how. It is very important to use the right methods, materials, and set-up for this kind of stuff.

Remember, Safety 3rd!
