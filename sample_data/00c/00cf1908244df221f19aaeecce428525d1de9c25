<Odocoileus> "you've got a shit memory? Yet you know all these languages. Im mildly impressed." She smirks
<Kaeru> "'s like I said, necessity n' all that," they reply. "Plus it's fine, for the most part. Just in some ways it ain't."
<Odocoileus> She tilts her head a little, "what makes it shityy?"
<Kaeru> "Psychoactive amnesia," they say, shrugging. "'Least, that's the theory. I got nothin before I was maybe 14."
<Odocoileus> Her brow furrows a bit, "that can be moderately treatable. I have read a couple thesis documents of the study where neuropathic therapy is used. Basically triggering those broken synapses.*
<Odocoileus> "
<Odocoileus> "there are other treatments that aren't very safe though, but i mean you are an odd acception."
<Kaeru> They raise their left hand and wave it, eyebrows up-- a reminder, indicating their synthetics. They shake their head; "Not exactly an option."
<Odocoileus> She holds their hand as the wave it. "It was just a suggestion, not really an offer. Im not a brain surgeon."
<Kaeru> They chuckle. "Nah, I know. I've made my peace with it, anyhow. At this point I think it'd be worse if I could remember them." They give a casual smirk.
<Odocoileus> She nods and hugs them.
<Kaeru> They hum in a pleased sort of way. "Mm, thanks, sugar, but I'm aight. I've had a while t' get past it."
<Odocoileus> She pulls back and rubs her neck a little, "i have s weird kinda question for you..."
<Kaeru> They give her a curious, expectant look. "Shoot."
<Odocoileus> She hesitates for a long time, but after an awkward amount of silence she huffs, "how...do you feel about me?"
<Kaeru> They blink, looking surprised. "I, uh. Oh." They stop staring and look down slightly, eyes scanning back and forth, unfocused, thinking. Their brow furrows slowly. "I-- I think--" a wide smile fades into being on their face, looking a bit manic combined with slightly widened eyes. "I-I--" They shake their head. "No one's ever asked me that before." They chuckle, shoulders shaking gently. They look up-- 
<Kaeru> it looks odd, on them, to see an emotion so openly displayed, no neutrality or suppression-- and they're grinning, looking almost as though they're on the verge of tears but their eyes are dry. "No one's ever asked me that," they repeat.
<Odocoileus> "hey hey whats wrong? Im sorry i shouldn't have said anything. Sorry." She looks really nervous and gently cups their face
<Kaeru> They put their hands over hers, closing their eyes for a moment and shaking their head quickly. "No, no, Eliza, don't be sorry," they say, smile wide and genuine on their face. They look at her. "Nothing's wrong. I'm happy. I'm really happy."
<Odocoileus> She turns deep red and looks at them with a mix of confusion and shock.
<Kaeru> "God--" they shift their hands to rub their eyes, chuckling lightly. "I can't cry anymore--" they laugh. "God-- I'm sorry, Eliza, I'm just-- I've never- nobody's ever--" they stop, shaking their head and dropping their hands so they can look at her. "I'm just really happy. It's, uh." They chuckle. "It's a little scary, to be honest."
<Odocoileus> "w-what?" She squeaks out.
<Kaeru> They take a deep breath and their face falls into a soft, happy smile. "I haven't really had anybody I cared about," they admit. "The only friend I ever really made was Seb and he-- god, he watched me die--" they close their eyes for a moment to take another breath. They open them and meet her gaze. "I really care about you," they say, smiling. "And I have no idea what I'm supposed to do." They shake 
<Kaeru> their head slightly. "I've never done this before."
<Odocoileus> She looks a little saddened and nods.
<Odocoileus> "look, i really like you to. More than i should. But...i cant..i..just.."
<Kaeru> Their face shifts to concern. "No, no, sugar, pumpkin, sweetheart, don't be sad," they say, cupping her chin gently. "It's okay. It's okay. It's hard to explain what you're feeling, I know, but I-- I /know/. I understand, okay? It's okay. You're okay."
<Odocoileus> She looks around nervously, "d-do...you really?"
<Kaeru> They nod. "Yeah. I do. I know." They smile at her faintly, reassuringly. "And it's okay, I promise. Take your time. You're safe."
<Odocoileus> She hugs them tightly, and nuzzles them into their neck
<Kaeru> They hold her gently. They murmur soft reassurances in English and Hebrew.
<Odocoileus> She nuzzles into their neck, and mumbles something in Italian.
<Kaeru> They chuckle. "Damn," they say, "And I never bothered to learn a romance language."
<Odocoileus> She snickers a little, "shut up."
<Kaeru> They laugh. "Never."
<Odocoileus> She kisses their cheek.
<Kaeru> They look at her, a devious but happy smile on their face. "Now I have a very important question for you."
<Odocoileus> She shrinks a little. "Yeah?"
<Kaeru> They're smiling, amused. They lean in and make a show of looking around as if checking that no one's around to listen. Then they whisper. "Do you want to go to bed," they ask, "Or..."
<Odocoileus> She drapes her arms around their neck and kisses them.
<Kaeru> They seem startled, but laugh. "Guess that answers my question, doesn't it?"
<Odocoileus> She smirks, "what do you think?"
<Kaeru> They chuckle. "Well, I think the rest of that sentence was going to be 'or do you want to fuck me senseless."
<Odocoileus> "please do, sweetie." She nibbles on their earlobe.
<Kaeru> They snicker. "Aight," they say, hands grabbing roughly at her hips.
<Odocoileus> She grins and traces lines down their neck with her fingers.
<Kaeru> They hum softly and work at starting to undress her.
<Odocoileus> She lifts up her arms for them to take off her shirt
<Kaeru> They do so, then remove their own, first pulling a few remaining wires from ports to allow this.
<Odocoileus> She slips her hands around their waist and let her fingers travel up their spine.
<Kaeru> They shudder as her fingers roll over the ridges.
<Odocoileus> She grins and whispers in their ear, "tell me what you want." Her fingers trace circles up their spine
<Kaeru> They make a soft, pleased humming sound. "You," they whisper. "However you want. There, here--" they touch gently to their neck for a moment before it falls to rest on their chest. "Even here, if you want. I won't stop you."
<Odocoileus> She turns bright red. "R-really?" Her fingers linger over their chest
<Kaeru> They nod. "Just be... careful. If you do."
<Odocoileus> She nods and rests her forehead against theirs "why dont we start out slowly." She grins and rests her fingers on their neck. "Ill be nice and gentle.~"
<Kaeru> They shiver slightly and close their eyes. "Okay," they say, and shift so they can lay back.
<Odocoileus> She pushes them back to lay down and bites their earlobe as she slowly works her finger tips between the seams on their neck. "im gonna take good care of you sweetie." She moans into their ear
<Kaeru> They sigh softly. Then, in a joking, though slightly breathy tone, "You better. You break me, I'm suing."
<Odocoileus> She kisses up their jawline, "if you can find me." Her fingers slip into their neck and softly caress the tender spots underneath.
<Kaeru> They gasp sharply, their core spiking to life. They lean their head to one side to allow her better access, exhaling a shaky moan.
<Odocoileus> "god you make the cutest faces like this." She moans into their ear. Her other hand snakes down to their hip and gently presses between the seams, pushing part the metal.
<Kaeru> Their breath catches and they tip their head back, panting (breath still shallow, as it always is, but heavier than usual.). "Ohhhh, fuckk-- shh-it- that's good," they breathe.
<Odocoileus> She grins, "yeah, sweetie?" She slips her fingers in to their hip, and lets both her hands work the synth gently and slowly strokes
<Kaeru> Their core rises, blue bright and deep. They writhe very slightly under her, exhales shuddering and beginning to be tinged with static and sound. "Y-yeahhh-hh-ahhhsh-hhit--"
<Odocoileus> "hmm? You want me to stop?" Her finger stop working and hold still
<Kaeru> A small whine escapes them. "N-no- don't-- god, keep /going/," they whisper.
<Odocoileus> "what do i get out of it?" She moans into their ear and draws light circles with a single finger in their neck
<Kaeru> Their core spikes and they growl, a low, synthetic sound. "You know /exactly/ what you get out of it, sugar," they hiss, fingers slipping beneath the edge of her shorts.
<Odocoileus> "hmm... What would that be?~" her finger gently dance along the synthetic as she presses herself against them
<Kaeru> They press their palm flat against the very base of her abdomen, so their fingers near but don't quite reach her slit. Their core rises dramatically for a moment and the hum flows through their fingertips, strong and teasing. Within seconds, it softens, almost vanishing altogether.
<Odocoileus> She pants heavily and buckles a bit, letting out a moan. "F-fair..e-enough." she slowly picks up the pace of her fingers and work them in slightly deeper to get a good feel on the synthetic muscles, softly caressing and teasing the sensitive material.
<Kaeru> They inhale sharply, their back arching slightly. They gasp something in breathless Hebrew and their core begins to strengthen again. They allow the power of it to flow through their body, and she can feel it in every inch of them, strongest in the synthetics themselves, buried so close to the source. They breathe quickly and exhale soft moans.
<Odocoileus> She is very careful as she presses her fingers into the synth, trailing a single finger long them as she blows gently into their ear.
<Kaeru> They shiver, breath cool and humid, like evening mist. They attempt a sentence, but it quickly devolves into half-formed and jumbled Hebrew fragments, half static and shaped by moans.
