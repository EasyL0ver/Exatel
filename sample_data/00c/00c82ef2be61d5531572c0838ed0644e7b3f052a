	+ If you hear starwars music 'randomly' then it means an Admin has joined, make sure not to use this around when they are on or you will be banned like I was, hence why I am releasing this script.
	+ You do not need mana for any of the commands, I made sure of that one.
	+ I am very sorry for the terrible scripting, I understand it isn't the best but I don't take scripting exploit scripts seriously.
	+ Do not execute this more than one, it will not 'stack', but instead break certain parts of the scripts due to the Creators scripting.
	+ I did try to add commands such as .heal, .forcelightning, .repulse, etc.. but you automatically get banned for trying to fire the remote manually.
	+ YOU MUST OWN THE CHOKE POWER FOR THIS TO WORK, WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO GET TO LEVEL 15. I HAVE TRIED MANIPULATING THE 'LEVEL UP' REMOTE BUT IT DOES NOT WORK.
	+ I may add new commands in the future if I find ways to bypass the remotes. Bare with me.
	
	-- COMMANDS --
	
	NOTE: YOU CAN EITHER USE .COMMAND or /e COMMAND. NO MANA IS REQUIRED AND YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SPELL THE FULL NAME OF SOMEONE!
	
	+ bring <player>
	+ choke <player>
	+ spamchoke <player>
	
	
	-- UPCOMING FEATURES --
	
	+ use commands on an entire team
	+ use commands on people close/far from you (radius)
	+ kill command (teleports you out the map, uses force choke to bring them to you before dropping them and teleporting you back)
	+ instakill lightsaber (I know this is possible, but trying to find a way to not 'drop framerate')
