 	Jessica: Thank you for visiting Sprint. What questions can I answer for you today?	 
 	You: I'm okay, thanks. Wow, this chat box is a bit intrusive, heh. Here I was clicking on a radial button and all of a sudden I'm clicking in a text box.	 
 	You: Not your fault, though. Have a great day!	 
 	Jessica: Please wait while a secure chat connection is established.	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	You: This is actually hilarious. You interrupted my shopping to ask me to wait.	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	You: I mean, YOU didn't, person whose name I'm sure is Jessica.	 
 	You: Your poorly-designed system did.	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	You: It's just funny because I've been in your situation. I worked for Verizon's live chat for a while.	 
 	You: It wasn't better.	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	You: I'm sure.	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	You: Yep.	 
 	You: I'm just going to sit here and count the number of times that pops up.	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	You: And that totally classy chat sound.	 
 	You: That's six times, by the way. In case you're curious	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	You: Seven.	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	You: Eight! Eight-a lovely messages! Nyah ah ah ah!	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	You: Nine!	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	You: One of these days I'm going to write a bot to respond to you with "Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly." every time you say anything.	 
 	You: That'll show you.	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	You: Eleven! I missed one. Damn my rant.	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	You: Do you like the band "Five Iron Frenzy"? I just found them recently and they make me happy.	 
 	Jessica: Thank you for your patience. I will be with you shortly.	 
 	Jessica: Hello.	 
 	You: Hi!	 
 	You: I think you might actually be real!	 
 	Jessica: Yes, I am a real live person.	 
 	You: I'm sure. I had your job once. Well, for Verizon Wireless.	 
 	Jessica: I'd be happy to assist you and try my best to answer all your questions.	 
 	Jessica: Let's move this chat and make it a window of its own. It will be out of the way and I can stay with you in case you have any questions or any concerns. Just click on the "Yes" button below and we can continue. 	 
 	You: That's really not necessary. I mean, I didn't really have questions in the first place.	 
 	You: This chat popped up and I was just so amused that I stuck around.	 
 	Jessica: Okay.	 
 	Jessica: Simply click on the white "Yes" button below and you can end the chat.	 
 	You: Really? It seems like that would pop it out into a new window	 
 	You: That's what it says it does, anyway.	 
 	You: Is it lying?	 
 	You: Jeez, that other customer of yours is a chatterbox.	 
 	Jessica: Okay.	 
 	Jessica: Are there any additional questions I can help with today?	 
 	Jessica: A deposit allows you to maintain a base of funds that will ensure that your service is activated and maintained.	 
 	You: Is it a violation of any policy for me to post this transcript on a social media network?	 
 	Jessica: This deposit is completely refundable after one year of satisfactory payment history with Sprint.	 
 	You: Wow, really? I didn't know that!	 
 	You: So, I get it back after a year? Future me is going to be LOADED.	 
 	Jessica: Yes, you will get back after one year.	 
 	You: Wonderful. Well, Jessica, it really has been great talking to you. I just feel like we had such a connection.	 
 	You: But, all things come to an end, I suppose.	 
 	Jessica: Okay.	 
 	You: May your adventures be fruitful and full of sales!	 
 	Jessica: Have a good day.	 
 	You: Bye!
