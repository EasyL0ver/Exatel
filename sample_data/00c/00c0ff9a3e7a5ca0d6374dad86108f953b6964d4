Around me there are visions of the people who imprisoned me 
Drove me on the path to this condemned state of misery
Stare me in the eyes read my mind and judge me silently
What the fuck you want I'm not the kind to react violently
But fuck it
I'm out my brain tonight
Lookin in the mirror just to see this fucked up sight
Formaldehyde and diamorphine on the cuboard shelf 
What the fuck I don't even recognize myself

I often ask god why the fuck things got this way
The answer $uicide bumpin' with eternal grey
Yung Christ and Snow Leopard are the pastors of the sheeple 
I'm chanting suicide preach FTP to all my people
It's the apex of the night I feel like vultures are spectating
Scheming up and planning out the outcome of my ravings
Will I do or will I not finally go through with it
Down the street my forearm decorated by a slit 
I'm not one to cut but these thoughts be get'n intrusive 
It's just what goes on when your mind turns in reclusive
Suicidal thoughts piercing through me like an arrow
Tearing up my chest how will I wake up tomorrow
I'm slowly settling down I'm dozing off into the distance
There's many episodes and this one was just an instance
