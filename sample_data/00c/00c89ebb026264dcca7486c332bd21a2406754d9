Agile is an approach to projects that seek to provide an alternative to the documentation-heavy, process-driven, and sequential approach of traditional methodologies. It focuses on being incremental by breaking project work down into smaller, more manageable pieces, as well as being iterative by breaking the project timeline into repeated cycles. 
Since Agile is not a specific methodology, training in it is extremely important. Combining it with LSSGB adds to the work profile on providing quality with agile methods. One of the most common Agile training areas is for the Scrum Master role. The Scrum Master is responsible for enabling the development team to be as effective as possible and managing the Scrum process as a whole. This includes facilitating the various Scrum meetings and managing communication and expectations for the team. The primary focus of Scrum Master training is understanding the makeup of the Scrum process and how to empower team members.
