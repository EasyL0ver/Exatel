because you want drama
im simply trying to difuse the situation, but you're announcing everything publicly for others to get involved


BesimToday at 9:28 PM

AveryToday at 9:29 PM

BesimToday at 9:29 PM

AveryToday at 9:29 PM
No, id like an apology then
you falsely muted me, and publicly denounced me for others to just laugh at


BesimToday at 9:30 PM

AveryToday at 9:30 PM
