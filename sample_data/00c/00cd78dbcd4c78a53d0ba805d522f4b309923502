Wahid3251:  sadly life is like that
Wahid3251:  nothing is fair
PARO TUTTO:  it is
PARO TUTTO:  but its ok
PARO TUTTO:  you can get out of it
PARO TUTTO:  sometimes it feels like falling in that black deep hole
PARO TUTTO:  but you can like fall for years and years
PARO TUTTO:  maybe its not even your fault
PARO TUTTO:  but it happens
PARO TUTTO:  but hey
PARO TUTTO:  if i think about myself
PARO TUTTO:  i dont really have much that i love about my life

PARO TUTTO:  but it doesnt matter
PARO TUTTO:  they are a few still
PARO TUTTO:  but i feel safe and fine with them
PARO TUTTO:  what you should think about is
PARO TUTTO:  why considering yourself as the problem?
PARO TUTTO:  you are a 17 yrs old boy living his life
PARO TUTTO:  you never did anything bad to anyone i guess
PARO TUTTO:  and bad i mean something terrible
Wahid3251:  i may have stolen a few sweets from shop when i was younger

Wahid3251:  ;-;
PARO TUTTO:  oof
PARO TUTTO:  well
PARO TUTTO:  i understand
PARO TUTTO:  no jk i dont
PARO TUTTO:  i miss galio tho
PARO TUTTO:  :C
PARO TUTTO:  anyway
PARO TUTTO:  as i said before
PARO TUTTO:  why not trying to make this game
PARO TUTTO:  some sort of a medium
PARO TUTTO:  to let something bigger grow in yourself
PARO TUTTO:  you can try hard
PARO TUTTO:  push yourself to the limit and see how far you can go
PARO TUTTO:  no one said that you have to succeed
Wahid3251:  :o
PARO TUTTO:  but no one said that you will fail
PARO TUTTO:  i mean
PARO TUTTO:  you are good at this game alright?
Wahid3251:  yeah
PARO TUTTO:  but there are a few things that are still blocking you
PARO TUTTO:  in my opinion
PARO TUTTO:  its all a matter of time
Wahid3251:  yeah
Wahid3251:  i just need to
Wahid3251:  get past these things
PARO TUTTO:  some kids at 16 are super over confident and can destroy the world but they have other limits
Wahid3251:  blocking me
PARO TUTTO:  yeah man
PARO TUTTO:  but its ok
PARO TUTTO:  time to time
PARO TUTTO:  maybe
PARO TUTTO:  you also need to talk about it
PARO TUTTO:  and when you are stressed out
PARO TUTTO:  take a break talk to someone and let it go
PARO TUTTO:  then back at it
PARO TUTTO:  but you are still young
PARO TUTTO:  like
PARO TUTTO:  you dont have to be the best now
PARO TUTTO:  but you can become
PARO TUTTO:  the best
PARO TUTTO:  all that matters
PARO TUTTO:  is how hard you try
PARO TUTTO:  give yourself a shot
PARO TUTTO:  and see where you can go
PARO TUTTO:  i know that it can be boring and you may not be in the mood from time to time
PARO TUTTO:  it happens
PARO TUTTO:  but overally
PARO TUTTO:  you have to try
Wahid3251:  ay
PARO TUTTO:  i do believe in you sir
PARO TUTTO:  and
PARO TUTTO:  you have all the rights to be anxious and stressed
PARO TUTTO:  but dont worry 
when you feel bad because you lose and you drop back
think about when you got higher
if you did that, you can do it again and maybe even better
PARO TUTTO:  there are a few things that will make you grow up
PARO TUTTO:  be nice to yourself and be respectful
PARO TUTTO:  you are the only one who will make things happen for yourself
PARO TUTTO:  there will always be someone that will put you down
they have to become your strenght
Wahid3251:  understood sir
PARO TUTTO:  you are a good guy
PARO TUTTO:  i really think you can achieve good things
PARO TUTTO:  and you will see
PARO TUTTO:  be patient and have faith
PARO TUTTO:  you will overcome your obstacles
PARO TUTTO:  just take your time to do so
PARO TUTTO:  people who will make you rush thing are the ones who dont understand you
sometimes you might need a little push
PARO TUTTO:  but thats all
PARO TUTTO:  sorry if i mispell but im tired af
