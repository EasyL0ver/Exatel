Dec. 16
The old woman was watching me today. I tried telling Bogdan about her the last time, but he looked at me like I was going crazy. “All the civilians, they are either gone or dead” he told me. He should be right. But the old woman isn’t gone and she isn’t dead and I’m not crazy. I’ve seen her five times since General Lascar’s group was wiped out by the Russians, and I feel like she is watching me even when I can’t see her. 
She looks like some of the women we saw in the countryside. Dressed like a farm girl. Like a peasant. She has long gray hair. I’ve never seen her face, but I can tell she is old. She looks like she was very tall once, but now is hunched over by age. I see her now and then, picking through the snow and rubble in the distance. I can’t imagine what she’s looking for. She’s always picking, but she never seems to find what she is looking for. Once, she looked at me. I think she did. She was five hundred meters away and I was hidden, but she looked at me.
Lieutenant Dinu came by on his patrol a little while ago. He is a good officer, one of the only ones we have left. His face is wide and trusting, like a baby, but when the shooting starts he turns to steel. I still remember when he stopped private Dorin from raping that Polish girl. The lieutenant threatened to shoot his balls off and mail them home to his mother. Of course, he’s long dead now, buried somewhere out in the snow. It’s been nearly three months since we set up camp outside Stalingrad and I still don’t know what Antonescu was thinking when he sent us here.
The old woman scares me. I think she whispers to me when I sleep.
