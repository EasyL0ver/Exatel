Key: Ericdoss

Character: Cado Alistair

Skills(Tier 1): One-Inch Punch, The Claw

Reasoning: Cado is a Garuda Tribe member, lately a lot of important figures have died such as Kiburu and Paprika though that's now old news as the timeskip ended. So far he has not learnt anything over the timeskip, or anything special ever for that matter, yet more than anything wants to improve his ranking. (Plan to roleplay these skills as being learnt over timeskip)

With no truly unique abilities of his own it makes sense for him after many years to develop a move such as One-Inch Punch and Potentially The Claw. Especially since he is a Pride class that relies on high damage output skills One-Inch would give him proper use of Saiyan Dominance. His mate Okara already developed the wolf fang fist many years ago and this would give him something to contrast against her fighting style. 

The Claw while right now wouldn't do much in terms of damage would work later down the line when acquiring the proper skills for it. This however still works in his favor even now as a support skill letting him throw the enemy for a breather or throw them into a team mate so they can use their best skill such as Okara. 

(The requirements for One-Inch Punch are met but The Claw won't be met till the next set of rewards to buy Pin.)(edited)
