The sea is the native soil to fishes; take fishes from the sea, they take no joy, nor thrive,
but perish straight. So likewise the birds removed from the air (the abode whereto they
were born), the beasts from the earth, and I from England. Can a lamb take delight to be
suckled at the breasts of a she-wolf? I am a lamb nourished with the milk of wolves, one
that, with the Ethiopians inhabiting over against Meroe, feed on nothing but scorpions;
use is another nature, yet ten times more contentive were nature restored to the kingdom
from whence she is excluded. Believe me, no air, no bread, no fire, no water doth a man
any good out of his own country. Cold fruits never prosper in a hot soil, nor hot in a
cold. Let no man for any transitory pleasure sell away the inheritance he hath of
breathing in the place where he was born. Get thee home, my young lad, lay thy bones
peaceably in the sepulchre of thy fathers, wax old in overlooking thy grounds, be at hand
to close the eyes of thy kindred. The devil and I am desperate, he of being restored to
heaven, I of being recalled home.
