Corring
[19:50:30] Corring: Hey there jc!!! I‚Äôm really happy guess what I found out
[19:51:43] Kiise Ryouta: Oh,hello!
[19:51:53] Kiise Ryouta: And..Got no idea.
[19:52:06] Kiise Ryouta: Why don't you tell it yourself?
[19:53:26] Corring: Well I found out in a class I got a B in before it was close enough where my professor changed it to an A so I have a gpa of 3.893 and with my current artwork I may be able to get into Stanford ^o^
[19:54:17] Kiise Ryouta: Wooooah!!! Seriously!!!? OMG!! Amazing, Michael-san!!!!
[19:56:16] Corring: IKR, I just have to put together a good portfolio, but I checked on the level of the other art students and I‚Äôm feeling pretty confident
[19:58:20] Kiise Ryouta: That's really cool! I am sure you can make it. Best of luck for your future! :D
[19:58:38] Corring: Thank you so much jc^^
[19:58:47] Corring: where is it you‚Äôre planning to attend?
[20:02:18] Kiise Ryouta: You are welcome. Well, I am currently pursuing B.A in a college here and after that I would probably be carrying on with my PG and higher studies around here, I suppose.
[20:03:47] Corring: Ba is bachelors I think? What‚Äôs PG? My parents do most my college signing up and stuff
[20:05:50] Kiise Ryouta: Yes, B.A is bachelor of Arts (there are a lot of branches from which I have chosen English)and PG is Post graduate,something you can pursue after your UG (Under graduate).
[20:06:38] Corring: Ohhh I see
[20:06:44] Kiise Ryouta: And all the B.A, B.B.A, B.com, MBBS, BDS etc come under UG. Yup
[20:07:27] Kiise Ryouta: So, in the uni what are you going to major in?
[20:09:46] Corring: Well I wanna get my highest degree in arts (because teachers get paid as their highest) but probably something something in child development
[20:12:01] Corring: I ‚Äúmay‚Äù get a B.A for art and possibly pursue a law degree after because it‚Äôs relativly easy after the BA but that‚Äôs because in America law degrees have a lot of prestige and could be an access gate for me t teacher multiple subjects
[20:12:22] Corring: but I know in the the rest of the world law degrees aren‚Äôt as valued as teachera
[20:13:35] Kiise Ryouta: Ah, I see and not really, tbh, even if you are a teacher you will be measured based on the subject you have taken up and such...so,yeah.
[20:14:11] Kiise Ryouta: Wait--there is a seperate B.A for art?
[20:14:19] Corring: Well I would like to teach every subject for the most part with teachers having the basic general education degree
[20:14:40] Corring: because I‚Äôm pretty well versed in most subjects, though some more than others
[20:16:10] Kiise Ryouta: Er... to teach every subject you have to pursue different degrees. Eg: B.A English, B.A History, B.Com CS, B.Sc Maths, B.Sc Chem etc...
[20:16:18] Kiise Ryouta: Plus these are just basics
[20:16:36] Corring: General education or law degrees actually branch out pretty easily
[20:16:57] Kiise Ryouta: Law,yes.And general education..?
[20:16:58] Corring: im told you don‚Äôt need a degree in every field with those
[20:17:17] Kiise Ryouta: Then how can you teach those subjects?
[20:17:28] Kiise Ryouta: Is it not essential?
[20:17:50] Corring: Well to teach at a college level I think those subjects have to be majors
[20:18:13] Kiise Ryouta: Ah, school..yeah, B.Ed is required
[20:18:57] Corring: I‚Äôm just doing what my counselor suggested as for a curriculars
[20:19:13] Kiise Ryouta: Ohhhh
[20:19:23] Kiise Ryouta: Maybe things work differently here
[20:24:24] Corring: Maybe
[20:24:30] Kiise Ryouta: Mhm
[20:34:51] Kiise Ryouta: So,you are on a holiday rn?
[20:35:47] Corring: I just finished my summer classes so sometime next month I start my other registered classes
