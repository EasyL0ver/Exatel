now, we stop for a shift
stars aligned we ghost
u wouldn't know we exist...
I've kept a steady eye
and never dropped my lead...
forgotten years cry for help
my sin is I love you
would it hurt less if I went to hell
if I stopped the arrow
I changed god's mind
so, who am I..?
We break out, then
We make out like kings
All that matters is the you and I
Not the fake shit
It's the little things
I know life a little
and shit is hard
Would it kill you not to break my extremely fragile human body?
