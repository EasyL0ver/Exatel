DiscoDude: **---BEGIN SESSION---**
DiscoDude: **Session logging commenced**
Ryusui: The three of you completed your business at the Farthing Bank, though not quite the way you expected!
Ryusui: Merlin's Notes were nowhere to be found, but instead you found a statue - an angel statue - which appears to be a clue to their location!
Ryusui: It's hard to tell whose side Vladimir Collingrad is on, but after a rather awkward and violent introduction he seems willing to cooperate with you!
Ryusui: *"First things first,"* he said after you left the bank. A scene cut later, and he's walking out of a run-down convenience store with a brown-bagged glass bottle in hand, which he promptly took a swig from. "All right. That's taken care of. So, to our next subject of importance: the statue!"
Kingfisher: "I see why you stopped me, but can you remind me why we're allowing him to follow us? He seems entirely extraneous." Kingfisher whispers to Selene, but loud enough that everyone can hear it.
Kingfisher: (Also, nick up <@!Selene>.)
Reality Glitch: ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs a map we have to share, right?  I say we start deciphering it right away.‚Äù
Kingfisher: Of course, he leaves out the opinion that Selene and Eli are both liabilities in his eyes as well, but at least he finds them within the remote ballpark of being trustworthy.
Selene: (I WAS doing that) Selene at least *attempts* to be secret about it, speaking quietly: "Well, If you had any idea on how to decode this thing, then i wouldn't have asked you to stop shooting, but now, sticking with as many people will help us speed the whole process of finding the *actual* Merlin Notes."
Ryusui: The statue bears no obvious markings. No curious half-engraved ciphertext, on its base or anywhere else. All the same, there is something curious: the base is rough-hewn. Like it was broken off of something else.
Reality Glitch: ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm curious as to whose deposit box we took it from.‚Äù
Reality Glitch: I look at the hewing to see if there‚Äôs a decreeable pattern.
Kingfisher: "I've no idea, and I doubt it's important," said Kingfisher. You know; like a liar.
Reality Glitch: ((üòÑ))
Ryusui: "Ohohoho, that's the *fun* part. The bank's *owner.* She wanted to keep this clue all to her little self. There is, ah, quite a tale to be had here. But for another time. The important thing is...whatever this statue belongs to, it is the next step in our quest!"
Kingfisher: Kingfisher furrows his brow. That basically confirms it; this man is close to the enemy of his client. How else could he have known that... and a 'good story' behind it, to boot?
Reality Glitch: ‚ÄúHa ha; just the movies of my childhood.‚Äù I say, jovially, before taking a pensive look and saying under my breath, ‚ÄúWhich I just realized haven‚Äôt been made yet.‚Äù
Ryusui: All you can tell for sure is that either whoever carved it decided to give up after reaching the base, or it was broken off of something else.
Ryusui: It *is* quite a remarkable work of art, though.
Reality Glitch: ‚ÄúWell, I think the first step would be to find what this piece goes with, since it looks to be part of a whole.‚Äù
Selene: "But *what* could it belong to? Or did this farthing person leave the statue-handling to a butter fingers?"
Kingfisher: "I'm unsure where we should begin. Should we conduct our own investigations?"
Reality Glitch: ‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù
Kingfisher: (Basically, I'm wondering aloud about a montage.)
Ryusui: "Investigation! I like this plan!" Vladimir grins, and pulls out his gun. "People start talking when I bring my little Pokhmelye out!"
Reality Glitch: ((<@!Selene>; I don‚Äôt think our characters know of those two yet.))
Kingfisher: (We know that there's a "Farthing" of "Farthing Savings and Trust.")
Reality Glitch: ‚ÄúNot like that!‚Äù
Kingfisher: (But yeah, dunno if Indiana Jones existed at this point.)
Reality Glitch: ((I got Indiana and Nebraska mixed up.))
Selene: (I was making a joke BUT whatever.)
Reality Glitch: ((I get that, now.))
Selene: (edited :x)
Ryusui: (And yeah, I was planning on things going into a montage. XD How does everybody want to contribute? The key thing is everybody has to roll a *different* skill, since this is basically a Challenge like in the Core book.)
Kingfisher: (What would seeking out my client that I lied about not knowing about without anyone catching on entail?)
Reality Glitch: ((Knowledge; obviously.  Just let me think of how to flavor it.))
Kingfisher: (Stealth to make the call and meet up while making sure no one follows me or catches on that something's up?)
Ryusui: (yeah let's call it a Stealth check)
Kingfisher: (Vs. +2?)
Selene: (Hmm, i was thinking on rolling Contacts...)
Reality Glitch: ((Divination magic!))
Kingfisher: (The standard difficulty is +2, right?)
Ryusui: (yeah let's do +2)
Kingfisher: !f 3 (Stealth)
DiscoDude: <@Kingfisher> rolled 4dF+3 for 5 [4dF = [-][+][+][+]]
Kingfisher: (SWS! What does SWS mean on a montage?)
Kingfisher: (Come to think of it, what kind of Montage is this, <@Ryusui>?)
Kingfisher: (I remember there being multiple kinds.)
Ryusui: (it's a Challenge Montage, and also)
Ryusui: 
Ryusui: (basically you get a boost, and someone else can spend that boost if it makes sense)
Ryusui: (e'erybody roll!)
Ryusui: (oh, also)
Kingfisher: (Just did.)
Ryusui: !f 4 (Soldier)
DiscoDude: <@Ryusui> rolled 4dF+4 for 1 [4dF = [ ][-][-][-]]
Ryusui: (well, we know Vladimir's efforts don't pan out XD)
Reality Glitch: !f 5 (Knowledge)
DiscoDude: <@Reality Glitch> rolled 4dF+5 for 7 [4dF = [+][+][+][-]]
Kingfisher: (Question; do we want Vladimir to succeed?)
Reality Glitch: ((Boost!))
Ryusui: (you know what: i'm ruling you just get to take these boosts forward to the next part XD)
Ryusui: ( <@!Selene>! )
Kingfisher: (Come to think of it, do we just need to succeed at least half the rolls?)
Ryusui: (i'm gonna call it that, yeah)
Selene: ((Riiighttt...Do i roll Contacts, then?))
Ryusui: (if that's how you wanna roll it!)
Selene: (Oh well!)
Selene: !f 3 (Contacts)
DiscoDude: <@Selene> rolled 4dF+3 for 2 [4dF = [+][-][-][ ]]
Selene: ~~*(Sounds of broken glasses in the distance)*~~
Kingfisher: (So, do we succeed as is?)
Kingfisher: (Two SWSs and a tie should be enough, I think.)
Ryusui: Gilligan Cut from Eli's "Not like that!" to Vladimir threatening some rando in a back alley. "Do you recognize this statue?" he snarls, waving both a photograph and a gun in the terrified man's face. *"Do you recognize this statue?"*
Kingfisher: (Pfft.)
Reality Glitch: ü§¶
Ryusui: Cut to <@!Kingfisher> finding Septimius in yet another dark, smoky drinking venue. "Yes?" he says, raising an eyebrow at you.
Ryusui: <@!Selene> is trying to call someone on her expensive giant-ass brick cell phone...and waiting impatiently for a response.
Kingfisher: He shows him the photo. "This is what was in the deposit box. No notes. Any recognition?"
Ryusui: <@Reality Glitch>: Eli has found a quiet, enclosed space to perform a divination ritual. The circle of runes has been inscribed. All that remains is to focus.
Reality Glitch: ((I have a bad feeling about this.))
Ryusui: <@!Kingfisher>: "Ah yes. The sentimental old biddy. Of course." He spits.
Selene: "C'mon, C'mon you darn idiot, pick up your stupid rotary and answer..." *She is indeed inpatient, tapping her right foot and her tail swinging from side to side, the later proving to be somewhat of a hazard at the speed its moving at.*
Ryusui: (<@Reality Glitch> you wanna do anything for your response, or should I continue it cutscene-style?)
Reality Glitch: ((Just spring your trap already.))
Ryusui: (dude you rolled a success)
Ryusui: (i'm not that kinda GM)
Kingfisher: "I'll take that as affirmative?"
Reality Glitch: ((I know, but you had some ominous narration.))
Ryusui: (i was just describing the scene?)
Ryusui: <@!Selene>: Stosus finally answers. "Any luck with the Notes?"
Reality Glitch: ((Can I be the one to describe what the information I divine?))
Ryusui: (uhhhh. are you...asking if you have permission to dictate plot details which may contradict what i'm just about to reveal to the others)
Reality Glitch: ((Sorry.))
Kingfisher: (Need a response, and hopefully some real answers on my end.)
Selene: "There were *no* notes, only an statue, do you have anything on that?"
Ryusui: <@!Kingfisher>: "One of seven. Carved out of a single piece of stone." He hands you back the photo. "The St. Frederica Church is where you'll find the rest." He begins scribbling down an address.
Ryusui: <@!Selene>: "A statue? An angel statue, by any chance?"
Reality Glitch: Concentrating on the statue, I carefully trace the object‚Äôs history back from my acquisition of it too see if I can follow it all the way back to its point of origin.
Ryusui: <@Reality Glitch>: Your third eye opens and the statue is clear in your vision. The image in your mind pans out: it has six siblings, all part of the same sculpture. Pan out again: pews, a lectern, a church. Pan out yet again: a view of the surrounding city. You could find it easily on a map now. But also...
Selene: "Uhhh..." After quickly look away from her cellphone for a moment. "Yes, why so?"
Kingfisher: "I won't ask about your feelings on the matter. Not my place." He gives him a look. "If this has truly gotten personal for you, however, I need to know you won't be a liability first."
Ryusui: ...the view pans out further, and you can see darkness around the edges. The enemy is closing in.
Reality Glitch: ((Cellphone?  In the ‚Äò80‚Äôs?))
Kingfisher: (Brick-shaped, I think.)
Selene: ((Cellphone, Bricphone, its the same!))
Ryusui: (yes, i made it clear that it's one of those giant old-fashioned brick phones XD)
Selene: (^^^)
Reality Glitch: I try to zooming on the darkness, to see if I can get a higher-definition image of it.
Ryusui: <@!Kingfisher>: Septimus bangs his fist on the table, nearly knocking over his drink. "Of *course* this is *personal.* It's *always* been *personal.* This is *my inheritance* we're talking about here. My *birthright* as the heir to the Far..." He clears his throat.
