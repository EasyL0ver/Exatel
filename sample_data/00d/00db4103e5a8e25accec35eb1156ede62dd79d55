A couple of good maps I think would be great for the SxG Zombie Mod server.

- ze_retribution

Reason - 4 Driveable cars, 3 escape points, and a controllable cannon. 'Nough said.

- ze_tilex_escape

Reason - The map looks like it's poorly made, but underneath that is a load of good gameplay.

- ze_thelostworld_redux

Reason - An incredibly revamped version of the original Lost World (See below).

- ze_thelostworld

Reason - A giant map full of Jurassic Park dinosaurs. It's different from the Redux version because it has different gameplay elements.

- ze_rooftop_runaway_1_v4

Reason - Numerous escape routes, extremely balanced gameplay, and has a load of traps and goodies hidden inside of it. 

- ze_rooftop_runaway_2_v5

Reason - The sequel to the first map, this one picks up where that one left off. You run across rooftops once again, but this time with twice as many traps, obstacles, etc.

- zm_atix_helicopter

Reason - It's not so much of a massacre map as much as it is a escape map. Humans must defend the place for about 2 or 3 minutes before the chopper comes into place, picking them all up. The zombies still have a chance to get the humans in the helicopter, however.

Of course, these maps will need addons. Here are a couple:

- Rank

Reason - Incase you don't have it already, you should get rank. I'm pretty sure you know why you'd want to.

- Parachute mod

Reason - If somebody fell from a high fall, they'd be able to open up their parachute and be saved. Plus it would make it feel more cinematic and all around awesome.

- Noblock

Reason - Quite possibly the most needed one. I can't tell you how many times I've been glitched out of a vehicle or blocked to get into a safepoint due to noblock being off.
