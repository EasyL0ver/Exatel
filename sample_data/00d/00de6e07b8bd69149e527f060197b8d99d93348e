About me:
My name is David. I'm 19 years old born in Slovenia +2 GMT. I do not have a job altho i amm trying my best to find one. I enjoj playing sports and doing outside activitys in general. I like playing basketbal and football. My favurite game on the computer is generationx. I enjoj playing generationx aswell as i enjoj hanging on the forums whit my friends.I am not realy good at grammar but i will still do my best on this application.

Me and generationx:
I have joined Generationx ingame in erly october and have so been ingame for 10 months. I have made my forums account on 17th.feb.2012 I frst started playing generationx on my account named stereo. There are so many good memorys on that account. I left that account behind since i was ragged at by africa becouse of a missunderstanding and got my first and last mute ever. Then a account named Pkvid came to be. Since i created that new account i have made many friends aswell as earnd respect by the community. At the begining when i did not know how to brid i woud always wach james how he was briding and try to learn to. I eventaualy learned how to brid and joined a clan named Genx Finest. I have been in that clan for a long time. Now since i have reached all the forum requirements i decided to make a application for a veteran. I have learned alot of things since comming to generationx. This server is not only a runescape private server to me but like a virtual home where i can express my fealing when something bothers me or when im happy about something. I can also say things i might never say irl.

Why I deserve this:
I think i deserve the veteran rank since i meet all the requirements and am also a very helpful persone in general. I have helped many new and old players over the time i have been here. I have made signatures for free made a guide and suggestions. I also helped resolute finding the duping glitch and also anoyed him until he took a look into our suggestions. I do belive i fit the title of a rolle model since i heard many new and old people say that they admire me or are my "fans". I will not lie i have been in a few flaming situations but nothing that deserver a mute or even a warning.

Thank you so much for reading my application.
