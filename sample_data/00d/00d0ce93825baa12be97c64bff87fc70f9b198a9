about that delirium review... first of all. you are ignorant and dumb, as a reader and as a person. It IS possible to have a world where love is a disease. You don't have to know what it is outside portland, pretty sure you would just say 'why the fuck is lena telling us the story outside portland? lena is fucking stupid i don't care about that' and the story is in FIRST person point of view, and she won't tell anything about outside portland because SHE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT EITHER DUH. besides, that part is for you too understand. Why do you think the USA is bordered? BECAUSE LOVE ISN'T A DISEASE OUTSIDE USA.

In the part where you say that the society is similar to what we have know, i don't think it is a problem. it's actually a advantage for readers, it is easier for us to understand and connect to their world. The time is probably was sixty-four years from now because that was she said IN THE FIRST PAGE, if you noticed, which i doubt -___- And as i said, it isn't really the main point of the story.

Maybe it's you who had a problem because you have too great expectations. in that society, YOU CAN remove love from humans beucase 'scientist' found a way but you wouldn't know that because YOU'RE NOT AS SMART L O FUCKING L. They remove a part of a brain that triggers feelings or whatever and they lost all that feelings of love or sadness or happiness, therefore there would be peace. People can raise children without love, if you ask me and people can be normal teenagers without being loved back, becuase for your information, it's already a typical situation now. What's so unbelievable? So what if 'love' is such a big word for lena and she said it. Sex is a big word for children but they ask their parents 'mom, what is sex?' they said the word sex, and OH, THAT'S A BIG DEAL SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX. I SHOULD BE IN JAIL OOOOHH. -__-

This is not a action book, so you should not expect lena to kill people and the book to have much action as you want.

Lena is a weak character from the start. BUT DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE WORD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT? I don't think so since you're so dumb. She is a weak character, but she developed. She became strong and brave, which you saw by the end of the book. Lena is just like EVERY TEENAGER in this fucking world, SHE'S ORDINARY AND LACKS SELF ESTEEM. Do you expect every fictional character to be perfect? Do you expect every teenager to be perfect? NO. Becuase not everyone in this world is so confident for you to love and worship. SHE'S INSECURE, RESPECT THAT OK. Maybe you're so confident that's why you hate her so much, but nobody cares about you anyway. 
Then suddenly, she feels pretty and witty and gay beucase she's with alex. ALEX MADE HER FEEL BEAUTIFUL OBVIOUSLY DUH -.-

As I said, she's like every teenager in this world, SHE FEELS INSECURE AND SHE NEEDS SOMEONE TO MAKE HER FEEL BEAUTIFUL. You're the one who should shut up and be in the right logic.

Anyway, alex is NOT perfect. He has vulerability, and not to mention HE'S AN INVALID. DUH 
p.s. vampires are stupid and edward cullen is gay lol ewww
and 'sparks when we touch' is supposed to be a metaphor but you don't know that obvs. Don't call lena a drama queen if YOU are yourself, making such a big problem out of this book that you hate so much becuase lena is such a sissy blah blah blah
"I actually wrote this quote down so I could share it with you: 'His eyes are literally dancing with light, burning as though on fire'"
Wow, you REALLY prepared to insult this book did you? BIG ROUND OF APPLUASE that is so sensible and so not childish of you, my dear

It's lena's life why do you care anyway? Anyway, alot of people are 100% more horny than her DUH.  ACCEPT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW LIFE AND SOCIETY WORKS. PEOPLE ARE HORNY AND THEY CRAVES SEX OK WHY DO YOU KEEP HATING ON LENA ALOT OF PEOPLE ARE LIKE THAT LOOK AROUND YOU
'Oh, I would have never expected THAT to happen, what a surprise - said no one, ever, while reading Delirium' said you who is so boring and don't have any fun in life even just in books poor you

'Everything is unbelievable forseeable' - i see you have VERY nice grammar compare to Lauren Oliver wow you SHOULD be newyork times bestselling author
Yes, you could really see what would happen in the book, but just like Veronica Roth said, Lauren Oliver's words has something special which makes everything surprising and makes the book exciting.
Yes, it's a trilogy you genius. *insert laugh track*

I bet you tho, that you can't even write a book as beautiful as Delirium or a trilogy that is NEWYORK TIMES bestseller which have fandoms because nobody likes you bye
