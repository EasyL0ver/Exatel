FOSTER DAUGHTER 3

***Base on App. so take it w/ a grain of salt***

At the restaurant, as MC & new employee/Yuhana dine together, MC says let’s eat plenty & NE says her thank you. Then, NE mentions it’s comforting w/ just the the two of them & w/o the coworkers present. MC downplays “What’s so good about an old man like me? Yu ju exaggerates too much.”  “What is wrong w/ you? You are the most wonderful person I know.”  “Haha, I don’t know if you’re just trying to make me feel good but that’s enough. When a young woman compliments me like that, it’s embarrassing.”  “Then, let me honest. I like you boss.” MC freaks out by saying Yu ju, what are you saying?!
NE then explains “When my father died, I thought he kept haunting me but when I see you, I feel different. My heart begins to beat faster. I’m not asking for much, I just want to go on simple dates & hold on to you.” MC, then, politely appreciates NE’s compliments & explains that she cannot distinguished between love & affection for him. He continues that they’re not familiar w/ each other, he’s not rejecting her, & let’s take things slowly.

At the apartment, a bored young girl/Seo Yuna flips through the TV channels when she stumble upon a gold mine/porn. She embarrassely mutters “This is the adult channel. Is this a paid subscription?” As she continues to watch, YG begins to reach below her belt, feeling a wet sensation & begins to undress {I feel strange. I can’t take it. I’m getting hot. I want to continue}
While the hardcore porn continues, the embarrassed YG lays on the couch as she continues removing her undies {Masturbation, should I. I never tried it before. I’m embarrassed but I’m curious. It feels good. Ah!}

Outside on the streets, MC & NE ending the night w/ a nightly stroll. MC says he’ll get the taxi & NE retracts that she’ll take the subway instead. MC insist on getting her a taxi, to make up for last time & signals one over. MC about to bid farewell when NE gives a slight peck on his cheek & tells him to be careful on his way back. Later, MC feeling a little swagger by mentioning that was great.

From the train to the taxi ride, MC thinking {I felt a lot different these past few days. Some were headaches, but the idea of loneliness is slowly dissipating.}

At the apartment, MC announces “I’m back. Did you had dinner yet? I’d like to... Seo Yuna?”
