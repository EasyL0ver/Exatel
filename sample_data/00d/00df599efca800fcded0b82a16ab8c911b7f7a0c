How do I watch?
On the home page there is a table with various sections matches. Click on the section matches you want, select a match and click it. A new page will open with a screen. Wait a few seconds for the stream to load and start watching. If the stream stopped, you can choose for other backup streams links on the Main TV channel pages. It's as easy as that.

Is there a recommended browser for watching the streams?
Certain streams work better on certain browsers. Firefox is generally the best to use for this site, though Chrome, Opera and Safari are also good. Some streams do not work at all on Internet Explorer and MAC PCs.

Do I need to download anything to watch?
With most new PCs, downloads should not be necessary for the majority of streams. Occasionally some streams may require a download of certain software. Links for the necessary software can be found on the Main TV Channels page or you can download it below...

How do I get rid of the ad blocking the screen?
The ad should disappear automatically after 30 seconds or you can manually click 'close ad'. Problems may occur if you have a low internet speed in which case it may take a little longer. Please remember this is a free site. Ads are necessary.
