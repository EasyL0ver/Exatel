I'm getting my info from Nesbar who is in contact with Rocky's GF, he asked me to pass it on to the board.

A few hours ago I tried to catch up with Brother Barrock on Facebook chat, just a "how's it going? it's a been while" type of greeting.

Just a minute ago, I got a reply from him but it was from his girlfriend. 

Barrock is in the hospital. They think a virus attacked his lungs and his heart. He's currently in the ICU and on a ventilator. The good news is that there is improvement, but he's not out of the woods yet. He has to take it one day at a time.

His girlfriend says they're at a great hospital and he's getting the best care possible. 

She gave me permission to tell you guys and will keep me posted on any new developments. I asked if she needed anything from us. All she requests that we all send him our thoughts, good vibes, and prayers for a full recovery.

I got his PayPal email if you guys are able to donate some money to him. I'm sure medical bills are going to be a motherfucker, so I figured this could help him. You can send money to notsoniceguyeddie@hotmail.com. If you can't donate, just keep your thoughts, prayers, and vibes going. The family appreciates it. 

Anybody wanting to send cards can send them to:
Ken Nida 
37138 Whitestone Dr 
Geismar, LA 70734

This sucks

Latest update from his girlfriend:
"his parents wanted me to ask if you could let anyone who is going to be in New Orleans for Wrestlemania this weekend, we're about an hour away in Baton Rouge and Ken can have visitor. I know it's a big weekend and I understand if it's not possible, we just wanted to make the option available. haven't been able to see him yet today but he's been improving. Hopefully by this weekend he'll be out of ICU or at least not on sedation medicine."
