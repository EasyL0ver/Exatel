 * any function can be rewrited as iterative or recursive. Writing this
 * function as iterative may produce a lower efficient function.
 * 
 * This functions does not return anything since it uses the standard PHP
 * output throught 'echo' function.
 * 
 * @param object $baseNode	It can be any class implementing the 'getValue()',
 * 							'getLeftChild()', and 'getRightChild()' functions.
