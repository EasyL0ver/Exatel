Hello Gosu,

I would just like to ask you nicely, if you can please from now on, either leave the original creators credits but with "of KryptoDEV" on it, like "LaiLaiNoob of KryptoDEV" not actually linking back to KDev or remove the KDev release's all together.

The reason why I'm asking is because I have mutual respect for WoG hence why you don't see Release's from WoG on KDev as well as the creator. We're both trying to run DEV Communities here, and thats perfectly fine. However, 1 difference, people from KDev are freely allowed to talk, or link back using vBSEO to WoG without consequences.

So if you could do the same in a sense, keep that respect as well have respect for the Author's Wishes. That would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Sparks.
