[19:25] Lin Xiaohui made her way through the battlefield, punching and kicking aside soldiers with great force with a single goal in mind. She never cared about politics, never cared much about Gaiar or most of the denizens of Ardent but what she did care for was Qiao.

She had to find Qiao in this mess of a bloodbath in order to make sure she was ok. The brawler knew that the Ddrakanite was somewhere in this settlement and she made it her mission to find her and bring her back.

After punching her way through a few common footsoldiers, she came across someone who looked like a magi. Lin's eyes would narrow as she raised her fists towards Ambra.

"Oi, you! WHERE'S QIAO?! WHAT DID Y'LOT DO T'HER?!"

The harsh tone in her voice would go to show that she was deadest on finding this person. Just as intense as her yelling, her aura would spike out from under her. It seemed like the brawler had a vast pool of mana flowing from within.

[19:30] The wind began to pick up, swirling around the redheaded girl in front of Lin and kicking up some snow. The particles of snow being tossed around were illuminated by a radiant glow, the product of holy mana. As a small team of non-magi soldiers started a charge at Lin, Ambra dashed in front of them with blinding speed and outstretched her arms.

The Valmasian glanced over her shoulder and gave the non-magi a toothy grin.

"Don't. I'm here now, so you can get out of here." She waved them off, and so they went.

As she turned her gaze back to Lin her expression darkened almost immediately.

"Qiao? She's changed sides. She spends a lot of time with her friend, Dan. She's safe, I can assure you."

Ambra then placed her hand on her blade's hilt, and unsheathed it in a wide sweeping motion. She held it in one hand and bounced lightly on her heels, clearly a mobile fighter. 

"But--â€¦ I can'tlet you continue fighting. This is my home, see? And -no one- is going to take my home or my family from me. I don't want to hurt you though I fear I'm going to have to stop you, here and now."
(Ambra)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[19:31] Lin Xiaohui says, "I don' give a damn 'bout harmin' y'home or y'loved ones. I'm bringin' my friend home..."
[19:32] Ambra says, "I can't let you do that.."
[19:32] Ambra says, "Though.. I'll take you to her after I defeat you."
[19:38] ** Lin Xiaohui has inflicted an injury upon Ambra. ("Permanent Injury", "Permanent Injury", "Permanent", "Severity: MODERATE (-20 Vit)") **
[19:51] Lin moved in with her fists held high. The blood pumping through her veins and the mana surging from her circuit was a testament to how much she was getting into the fight. Once she got close enough, the energy-induced brawler would crack a cocky grin on her face and bring her left hand up to catch Ambra's sword. This normally would slice off many a hands magi and non-magi...

However, Lin was wearing gauntlets of Nyeshk. Zhengjing & Jingshen, Brawler and Spirit they were named.

"Alrigh' then, y'wanna dance lass? I've danced with y'swords folk plenty of times. But as I've always said, swords are borin'. I find myself more of a brawler, someone t'get their hands dirty up an' close..."

With Ambra's sword still gripped in Lin's gauntlet, She'd lean in to press her forehead against Ambra's, that cocky smile ever growing.

"Allow me t'demonstrate."

Suddenly, Lin would rear her head back before deliving a harsh headbutt to the redhead's forehead. This would open her up to what would be a relentless onslaught.

Letting go of Ambra's sword, she'd tighten both of her Nyeshk Gauntlets into fists before yelling out.

"I'M BRINGIN' QIAO BACK EVEN IF IT FUCKIN' KILLS ME!"

The mana around her form surged out like a volcanic eruption.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"

Lin stepped forth and proceeded to deliver a barrage of punches into Ambra's chest. Each punch packed with the might of her mana, with the sturdiness of Zhengjing & Jingshen. With each punch, her energy aura surged stronger. After the 90th punch or so into the lighting quick onslaught of punches, Lin would deliver a haymaker right into Ambra's chest, sending her flying across the field.

Ambra would DEFINITELY feel that given her ribcage was now practically nonexistent.
(Lin Xiaohui)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[20:00] Searing pain flowed through her entire body.

The older woman was obviously more experienced, and had a greater deal of power behind her swings. Ambra made the beginner's mistake of assuming she held the advantage.. getting complacent.. and then paying the price. The Valmasian had never fought a brawler, and found it incredibly awkward when her strikes normally suited to disarming another bladesmen were completely inconsequential due to the nyeshk gloves.

How-.. No.. I can't-... Everyone's counting..-

Her thoughts were a jumbled mess after the headbutt, scrambled further by every strike to her chest. If it hadn't been so horrifying, she would find the woman's speed impressive. Her blade dropped to her side mid-barrage, unable to even hold it any longer. She was completely at the brawler's mercy.

A final blow, surely shattering anything that wasn't already broken sent her flying backwards and into the snow. The wind surrounding her dissipated, and it all grew silent for a moment.

Unable to move, resist or even catch her breath.. she laid in the snow, wheezing for air. Her hand extended towards Lin, a confused and pained expression of despair present on her face. It wasn't entirely sure what she was reaching for, perhaps.. mercy?

"S-Sto...Grrk.." Her breath left her, and she gripped her ribcage tightly. She had never experienced pain like this before.. and the only thing she could do was curl up into a ball and begin applying very faint traces of healing energy to her crippling injury.
(Ambra)

[20:04] Nao was relentless. Striking down gaiar soldiers, one by one, he noticed something. Something was off.

Ambra wasn't at his side.

He looked around frantically - something was wrong. Really wrong. 

He proceeded to pave his way through the masses of soldiers, his rapier coated in crimson, Aetherian blood. 

And he suddenly spotted her. On the snow, lying down, a purple haired woman above her.

The direst of the situations happened. She couldn't move - with the woman towering above her, god himself knows with what intention.
His breath hitched, seeing the scene. After all, he was wrong. Previously reasurring Ambra that both of them will be back safe and sound, that nothing will happen...

He couldn't have predicted that.

Insantly he called upon his cosmic aura, dashing into the frey like a damned torpedo.

He stood between Ambra and Lin, gripping his rapier tightly. 
He looked up, at the moon.
One final trial...
He closed his eyes, as blue motes of spirit energy poured from the moon - as if on top of Nao, melding with his cosmic aura, turning it slightly blue.

With such a boost, he raised his rapier, pointing it at Lin. He wouldn't dare looking behind him, at his lover. He saw her wounds... it would hurt him greatly, and mayhaps distract him.
"You... YOU..." - He breathed heavily, visibly pissed off.
"Show me your motivation. FIGHT!!!"
(Nao)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[20:11] Lin was busy catching her breath once the battle was over. Man how that onslaught took quite the energy away from her. She'd look towards Ambra's battered body with a neutral look on her face. Maybe she could take Ambra and trade to get Qiao back? That was all she wanted in the end.

As soon as she took a step forward, the brawler was greeted by another redheaded swordsman. However, unlike Ambra who was Valmasian, this one was clearly Izurhan.

Lin would stare at him in an irritated manner before finally speaking up towards the intervening party.

"This doesn't concern you, Izurhan. I just want t'bring Qiao back s'all. Y'friend over there prevented me from getting one of m'best friends back... She brought that upon 'erself!"

After Lin said this, her aura would flare up once more. Her energy was surging into even greater proportions. It was as if she was a bottomless source of pure, raw mana!

She raised her Nyeshk gauntlets up in an offensive position towards Nao, her eyes narrowing.

"Tell me where Qiao is an' I'll leave y'be with y'lass."
(Lin Xiaohui)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[20:13] Nao was enraged, if anything. Breathing heavily, he'd finally decide to dash forward, his cosmic aura trailing behind him.
"You've had your chance, now--"

-A shout.

"VANISH, SCUM!" - He yelled out, his mouth clearly more foul than usual. He's lost himself.
(Nao)

[20:31] Lin Xiaohui grit her teeth at the second swordsman rushed at her. Do they ever learn? With a roll of her eyes, she'd plant her feet onto the ground and wait for Nao to get closer and closer. 

Just a little more...

There! Just as Nao brought his sword down upon Lin, she'd deftly move her body off towards the side and grasp onto Nao's wrist. Using her immense strength, she'd yank Nao's wrist back to disarm the man before grabbing a hold of his arm.

"I WARNED YA' Y'FUCKER!"

Lin yelled out. As her energy aura grew more in strength, it was overpowering Nao's own connection to the cosmos. Alas, it would be too much for Nao's own aura to bear.

Pumping all her strength into her arms, she'd lift Nao over her shoulder and SLAM the
