I would love to join the staff team because I have a lot of free time due to my not being in school/college anymore. One of the reasons I would love to join your staff team because I have a lot of experience in being in a staff position about 1-2 years and I think my experience would give me a upper edge over other applicants. If I was to become staff here at classical roleplay I would be always busy and always trying to improve my staffing skills and others who I work with. I am very independent and does not need to be told what to do and how to do it. I would say I am a very active member with no warnings and strikes and have never been pulled into support due to any condition. I really like interacting with people. I see this community going far in the near future and a really good staff team with experienced staff would also benefit the community. I know how to follow CoC and I understand that anyone above me has final say over any matter. 

I would also like to join the staff team because at this time of year younger members of the ARMA 3 community will be getting into roleplay and some might not understand how to use the mods ect and I think as a member of the staff team we need to be helping them out by checking the fourms and teamspeak for any problems. Another reason why I would like to join the staff team is because I am a hard working and confident person who wants to help anyone and everyone because it gives me joy and pleasure to do so. 

My two main strengths I would say are determination and respectfulness and my weakness would be to attempting to please everyone but I guess that just apart of who I am and I know this might be really bad at some stages in doing this job like banning someone but if they clearly broke x rule then I am happy to give them there punishment.
