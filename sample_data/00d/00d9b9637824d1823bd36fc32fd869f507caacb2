An undercover cop, disillusioned by the recent murder of his wife, is implicated in the murder of an officer and must struggle to clear himself.
LAPD detective Tom Ludlow is a ruthlessly efficient, unorthodox undercover cop. Captain Jack Wander always covers for Tom, as do even his somewhat jealous colleagues. After technically excessive violence against a vicious Korean gang during the liberation of a kidnapped kid sex slave, Tom becomes the target of IA&#39;s hotshot, captain James Biggs, who feels passed over after Wander&#39;s promotion to chief. Tom&#39;s corrupt, disloyal ex-patrol partner Terrence Washington sides with IA but is killed during a shop robbery in Tom&#39;s presence.
I really liked Training Day and actually hoped Street Kings would be as half as decent. Too bad I also didn&#39;t know Street Kings was written/directed by the same guy as the Training Day making it a sure set up for a disaster. Why on earth would he even think he can pull off another cop thriller is beyond me (more money perhaps?) but there I was, unfortunately watching the consequences of it. <br/><br/>The story is more than predictable - tough cop Keanu with plenty of issues of his own gets involved with the big boys and the cover-up of something dirty within the LAPD. (Wow, what a creative plot, I&#39;d drawn in already) On his side he has his Captain (Forest Whitaker) who also seems to be above the law and definitely overacting the remnants of his role in the Last King of Scotland (another annoying minus for the movie). Through series of unfortunate events and with his badge on the line, Keanu has a change of heart and goes after the hand that feeds him willing to uncover who was behind a murder of one of his old partners Det. Washington and why. The whole change of heart seemed rather unlikely and we never get to really know Keanu&#39;s character or how this twist happens. But for all intensive purposes of the plot it does, and within 45 min into the movie, we already know all the answers: why the murder and the cover-up (laundering of the dirty money aka operation cookie-jar) and we know who&#39;s behind it all (the only person who has all the power in the movie: Captain Forest Whitaker). The End. <br/><br/>But no, sadly you are forced to sit through another 50 minutes pretending something different might happen. But it doesn&#39;t. After bunch of silly twists and turns, lots of gun action and near-death experiences, Keanu finally learns what the audience already knew: the Captain is behind it all. He shoots the bad guy, cleans off his name and yes, gets to go back home to a sexy girl. Awww... if that&#39;s just not the perfect feel-good movie, then I dunno what is. Yeah Hollywood, you&#39;ve done it again- another pointless movie for the masses!
Street Kings is very much like David Ayer&#39;s Training Day except it is not as suspenseful, and seems to regurgitate many elements from this impressive film.<br/><br/>The screenplay is very good and it feels very gritty and real. However, it is obvious early on how the film will progress and indeed end which is a real shame.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker is Wanderer and plays him with real panache (very much like Denzel Washington in Training Day). Hugh Lawrie is the most mis-cast character, he really does not come across well as Detective Biggs, so much so that he makes little impact when he is on screen, and how is accent is deemed acceptable I do not know.<br/><br/>For all its realism, it fails to identify itself from other corruption crime films, and the end really is to clear to push this beyond a satisfactory experience.
All the movie's treacheries, deceptions and story twists are marred by our lack of innocence. We see the big picture way before the characters do, and that pushes us right out of the movie and back into our seats -- the last place we want to be.
Street Kings is based on a screenplay by screenwriters James Ellroy, Kurt Wimmer, and Jamie Moss. It is a Japanese phrase, normally used to address someone midday. The direct translation is &quot;how is this day?&quot; For evening, you would say &quot;Kon Ban Wa&quot;. The character Biggs is captain of the Internal Affairs LAPD division. Ultimately his job is to uncover dangerous truths and do damage control through legal means. He is also passed up for promotion of Commander which went to the character of Forrest Whitaker.  a5c7b9f00b
