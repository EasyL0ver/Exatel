Nov 13, 7:35am. I feel guilty for making people worried. I don’t know why so many people DMed me trying to help or responded to my tweet but I’m still here now. I just wanted the pain to go away and I always doubt how much I matter whether it’s clear that people care or not. Whatever the case I don’t understand how people were so selfless. I don’t care about “attention”, I just want to feel like I matter and be happy... or at least not this empty. And I didn’t want to scare anyone, but I’m glad people can convince my depression that it’s wrong. None of you had to deal with me and you did it anyways. Thank you, and I’m sorry for being such an asshole.

For now, I’ll just take a bit of time away from Discord and such, and come back when I’m a bit calmer. I’m still shaking and my arms and legs are sore.
